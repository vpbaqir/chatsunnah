There are four types of people in this regard.\n\n\n \n\na) Some deny Him without proper investigation (i.e. atheists)\n\n \n\nb) Many make co-sharers with Him (like Christians, Hindus, etc...)\n\n \n\nc) And many believe in His Oneness (i.e. Muslims, Knowledgeable Jews, Knowledgeable Sikhs, Unitarian Christians etc...)\n\n \n\nd) However there are some who strictly but falsely claim to be protectors and right advocators of His Oneness (tawhid) like Jews and the so called “reformers of Islam (Salafis)”. But if we take a close look at their beliefs we will find many similarities, for example seating the Lord literally upon on throne [Ibn Taymiyya said in his Fatawa: \"The establishment of Allah over the Throne is real, and the servant's establishment over the ship is real (وللّه ـ تعالى ـ استواء على عرشه حقيقة، وللعبد استواء على الفلك حقيقة،) [Majmu` al-Fatawa, (5/199)].\n\n \n\nThe fourth category believes Him to have \"literal hands, shins, legs, eyes, Allah literally laughs, Allah runs (i.e. does jogging - this is not sarcasm because Ibn Uthaymeen the leading Salafi authority has accepted this in literal sense) etc…\" [Refer to Saudi Published English translation of Qur'an by Muhsin Khan/Hilali under Surah Aali Imran (3:73) or Page # 81] This is something which is main belief of Literalists and they propagate that Istawa al-al Arsh mentioned in Qur'an is to be taken literally, and the descent of Lord (ينزل ربنا) mentioned in hadith along with him being in the sky (fi as-Sam'a) is also to be taken apparently.\n\n\nThey declare Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'h as people of Bidah because we give figurative explanation which suits Allah’s Majesty. Amongst the fundamental proofs which literalists cite are:\n\n \n\n\n\n1) Istawa al-al Arsh and Salafi deception\n\n\n \n\nWe would like to start by exposing the deliberate fabrication/corruption to Tafsir Ibn Kathir done by none other than Salafis. Remember they propagate this tafsir the most by corrupting it's translation whereas in reality the original text goes against them on many crucial Aqida issues. With the Grace of Allah and indeed Allah is the best of planners, He made Hafidh Ibn Kathir (rah) destroy the literalistic ideology right under Tafsir of Surah al-Aa'raf Verse # 54. The anthropomorphists after finding no leave-way (excuse) had no option but to forge/fabricate/corrupt the English translation published by their leading publishing house i.e. Dar us Salam, Najd (Riyadh) Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\nQur'an states (7:54):\n\n\n\n\nإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى ٱلَّيْلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُۥ حَثِيثًا وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ وَٱلنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَٰتٍۭ بِأَمْرِهِۦٓ ۗ أَلَا لَهُ ٱلْخَلْقُ وَٱلْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ\n\n\n \n\nTranslation: Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days (in the manner befitting His Majesty), THEN HE DID ISTAWA (AS IT BEFITS HIS MAJESTY); He covers the night with the day, which hastily follows it. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed be Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds! [Al-Qur'an (7:54) - Translation taken with care from variety of analytical translations]\n\n\n\n\nThe great scholar of Ahlus Sunnah i.e. Imam Ahmed Reza Khan Fadhil of Baraili (rah) has kept this Mutashabih (allegorical) verse intact without translating word \"ISTAWA\" into Urdu or any other language. This is indeed the main belief of us Ahlus Sunnah i.e. we leave the verses as they are (not as Salafis perceive that leaving them as they were means taking literal meaning Naudhobillah). We can go in length to prove Tafwidh (attributing the meaning only to Allah without taking literal meaning) but the point here is to prove the Salafi fabrication.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFirst let us look at the Arabic passage of what Imam al Hafidh Ibn Kathir (rah) actually said:\n\n \n\n\n\n\nقال الإمام ابن كثير في التفسير القران العظيم\n\n: تفسير:{ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِۚ} فللناس في هذا المقام مقالات كثيرة جداً ليس هذا موضع بسطها وإنما نسلك في هذا المقام مذهب السلف الصالح مالك والأوزاعي والثوري والليث بن سعد والشافعي وأحمد بن حنبل وإسحاق بن راهويه وغيرهم من أئمة المسلمين قديماً وحديثاً وهو إمرارها كما جاءت من غير تكييف ولا تشبيه ولا تعطيل والظاهر المتبادر إلى أذهان المشبهين منفي عن الله لا يشبهه شيء من خلقه و{لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِۦ شَىْءٌۖ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ\n\n\nOriginal Translation:\n\n \n\n{Then He did Istawa (As it befits His Majesty) upon the Throne\"} People have \"TOO MANY POSITIONS ON THIS MATTER AND THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO PRESENT THEM AT LENGTH\" [فللناس في هذا المقام مقالات كثيرة جداً ليس هذا موضع بسطها] On this point, we follow the position of the righteous early Muslims (Salaf) i.e. Imam Malik, Imam al-Awza‘i, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri, Imam Layth ibn Sa‘d, Imam ash-Shaf’i, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Imam Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, as well as others among the Imams of the Muslims, past and present—(namely) \"TO LET IT PASS AS IT HAS COME WITHOUT SAYING HOW IT IS MEANT\"[، وهو إمرارها كما جاءت من غير تكييف], without any resemblance (to created things), and without nullifying it (wa la ta‘til):\"THE OUTWARD (LITERAL)\" meaning that comes to the minds of anthropomorphists is negated of Allah[والظاهر المتبادر إلى أذهان المشبهين منفي عن الله] for nothing created has any resemblance to Him: {\"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing\" (Qur’an 42:11)} [Tafsir Ibn Kathir Under 7:54]\n\n \n\n\n\nVS\n\n \n\n\nSalafi fabrication\n\n \n\nPlease note at the blue highlighted parts above and the red highlighted parts below in Salafi translation:\n\n\n\n\nSalafi fabrication: (and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne) the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza`i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa`d, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it (with the attributes of the creation), or altering or denying it (in any way or form). We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah. [Taken from www.tafsir.com which has been down now so you can check in hard copy of Tafsir Ibn Kathir published by Dar us Salaam, Najd (Riyadh), Saudi Arabia]\n\n\n\n\nWith the Grace of Allah ever since we refuted them on this point their www.tafsir.com website has been down, which contained the fabricated tafsir published by Dar us Salam.\n\n\n\n\nForgery # 1: Ibn Kathir (rah) has nowhere said that there are several \"CONFLICTING\" opinions over it's meaning. The word conflicting is concocted by translator without putting it in brackets, this they have done to confuse people about what Imam Ibn Kathir (rah) had actually said.\n\n\n\nForgery # 2: Then they cunningly attributed a lie to Ibn Kathir by saying: \"Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa\" ... Audhobillah Min Dhalik !! whereas Ibn Kathir (rah) is actually saying: TO LET IT PASS AS IT HAS COME WITHOUT SAYING HOW IT IS MEANT\"[ وهو إمرارها كما جاءت من غير تكييف], nowhere does he say that we accept the \"APPARENT MEANING\". Where have the salafis taken the word \"APPARENT\" from? This is an extreme corruption to the text. If you read the next part carefully you will realize that Hafidh Ibn Kathir (rah) is actually rejecting the \"APPARENT/DHAHIR\" meaning.\n\n\n\n\nForgery # 3: This one is most important! they said: \"We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah\" whereas Ibn Kathir (rah) is actually saying: \"THE OUTWARD (LITERAL)\" meaning that comes to the minds of anthropomorphists is negated of Allah[، والظاهر المتبادر إلى أذهان المشبهين منفي عن الله]. The Salafis cleverly removed the wording \"OUTWARD MEANING (الظاهر المتبادر)\" from in between to put dust in eyes of people that actually apparent/dhahir meaning is to be taken (Naudhobillah)\n\n\n\n\nMay Allah protect unaware Muslims from the fabrications/tampering of Islamic literature done by Salafis.\n\nWe would like to settle the score on issue of \"إمرارها كما جاءت من غير تكييف\" once and for all\n\n \n\nIn regards to \"To Allow them to pass as they have come\" the Salaf said (contrary to Salafi propagation):\n\n\n\nحدثنا أبو سعيد أحمد بن محمد بن زياد قال: حدثنا أبو حفص عمر بن مدرك القاضي قال: حدثنا الهيثم بن خارجة قال: حدثنا الوليد بن\n\nمسلم قال: سألت الأوزاعي والثوري ومالك بن أنس، والليث بن سعد : عن الأحاديث التي فيها الصفات؟ فكلهم قال: أمروها كما جاءت بلا تفسير .\n\nTranslation: Waleed bin Muslim (rah) said that he asked Imam al Awzai, Imam ath-Thawri (rah), Imam Malik bin Anas (rah), Imam Layth bin Saad (rah) about the \"HADITHS OF SIFAAT\" all of them said: They are allowed to pass \"WITHOUT TAFSEER\" [Al-Shariah by Imam al Ajri (7/104)]\n\nOthers said: Bila Kayfiyyah i.e. without saying how it is meant [Asma wa Sifaat of Imam al Bayhaqi (1/608)]\n\nImam Sufyan bin Uyayna (rah) said: All that Allah described Himself with in the Glorious Qur'an then \"ITS RECITATION IS IT'S INTERPRETATION. There is no Kayfia (asking how it's meant) nor likeness (tamtheel or tashbeeh) [As-Sifaat” by Imam al Daraqutni, Page # 70]\n\n \n\n\nThe Istawa part of this article is about to be concluded and in the end we should all read the magnificent Tafsir of Imam al-Qurtubi al-Ash'ari (rah) under Qur'an 3:7. All people should read the following beautiful verse of Glorious Qur'an which outlines the belief on Muhkam (Simple and order giving verses) and Mutashabih (allegorical) verses\n\n\n\n\nQur'an states:\n\n\n\n\n\nهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِنْهُ ءَايَٰتٌ مُّحْكَمَٰتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَٰبِهَٰتٌ ۖ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَٰبَهَ مِنْهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ ٱلْفِتْنَةِ وَٱبْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِۦ ۗ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ ۗ وَٱلرَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّآ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ\n\n\n \n\nTranslation: He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses are decisive, they are the basis of the Book, “AND OTHERS ARE ALLEGORICAL”; then as for those in whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead and seeking to give it (their own) interpretation. But none knows its interpretation except Allah, and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: We believe in it, it is all from our Lord; and none do mind except those having understanding. [Translation by Shakir: Surah Aali Imraan (3:7)]\n\n\n\n\nImam al-Qurtubi (Rahimahullah) writes under it:\n\n\n\nقال شيخنا أبو العباس رحمة الله عليه: متبِعو المتشابه لا يخلو أن يتبعوه ويجمعوه طلباً للتشكيك في القرآن وإضلالِ العوامّ، كما فعلته الزنادقة والقرامِطة الطاعنون في القرآن؛ أو طلباً لاعتقاد ظواهر المتشابه، كما فعلته المجسِّمة الذِين جمعوا ما في الكتاب والسنة مما ظاهره الجِسمية حتى اعتقدوا أن البارىء تعالى جسم مجسم وصورة مصوّرة ذات وجه وعين ويد وجنب ورجل وأصبع، تعالى الله عن ذلك؛ أو يتبعوه على جهة إبداء تأويلاتها وإيضاح معانيها، أو كما فعل صبِيغ حين أكثر على عمر فيه السؤال. فهذه أربعة أقسام:\n\n\nالأوّل: لا شك في كفرهم، وأن حكم الله فيهم القتل من غير استتابة.\n\n\nالثاني: (الصحيح) القول بتكفيرهم، إذا لا فرق بينهم وبين عباد الأصنام والصور، ويستتابون فإن تابوا وإلا قتلوا كما يفعل بمن ارتدّ.\n\n\nالثالث: اختلفوا في جواز ذلك بناء على الخلاف في جواز تأويلها. وقد عرف أنّ مذهب السلف ترك التعرّض لتأويلها مع قطعهم باستحالة ظواهرها، فيقولون أمِرّوها كما جاءت. وذهب بعضهم إلى إبداء تأويلاتها وحملِها على ما يصح حمله في اللسان عليها من غير قطع بتعيين مجمل منها.\n\n\nالرابع: الحكم فيه الأدب البليغ، كما فعله عمر بصبيغ\n\n\nTranslation: The Exalted said: {As for those in whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead and seeking to give it (their own) interpretation.}\n\n \n\nOur Shaykh, Abul Abbas (Rahimuhullah) said: Furthermore, the followers of the allegorical verses (mutashabih) are not free from:Following it and collecting it, seeking to raise doubts in the Qur’an and (seeking to) misguide the laymen as done by the Zanadiqah (deviants), the Qaramitah, and the refuters of the Quran. Or seeking to believe in the \"Outward (Zawahir)\" meanings of the mutashabih as done by the Mujasmiya (those who give physical body to Allah), those who collected from the Quran and Sunnah whatever gave a physical meaning when taken literally (dhahir).\n\n \n\nTo the extent that they believed that the Creator is a physical body and a fashioned form, possessing a face and other things: hand, eye, side and finger. Exalted is Allah from that, with the most Supreme Exaltation. Or they sought out these (mutashabih) with a view to manifest its interpretations and clarify its meanings. Or (they did) like Subaygh when he asked ‘Umar about them (the mutashabih) excessively.\n\nSo there are four categorical (verdicts) on them\n\nThe First: There is no doubt about their disbelief (kufr) and that the judgment of Allah concerning them is execution without even asking them to repent.\n\nThe Second: The most sound (opinion) is to make takfīr on them (to consider them to be kafirs), since there is no difference between them and worshippers of idols and images. And they should be asked to repent. Thereafter, either they’ll repent, or if not, they should be executed as is done to an apostate (murtad).\n\nThe Third: There is a difference of opinion concerning that (action) based upon the difference of opinion in the permissibility of (various) interpretations. And it is known that the madhhab of the Salaf (pious predecessors) was to leave the undertaking of interpreting them while being certain that the literal meaning (Zawahir) was impossible. So they would say, “Let it pass as it came!” And some of them (the Salaf) took the madhhab of manifesting its interpretations by interpreting it with meanings consistent with the (Arabic) tongue without definitively confirming a specific possible meaning.\n\nThe Fourth: The judgment for him is to be taught a profound lesson as Amir ul Momineen Umar ibn al Khattab did to Subaygh [Tafsir ul Qurtubi under 3:7]\n\n\n\n\nIf Salafis read this tafsir carefully they will be sure of their Imaan to be on wrong side. Plus even their interpretation of Salaf as-Saliheen's viewpoint is also wrong because Salaf as Saliheen just left the Mutashabih verses “WITHOUT TAKING LITERAL MEANING WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE AT FIRST PLACE AS RIGHTLY SAID BY IMAM AL-QURTUBI (RAH)”\n\n \n\n \n\n\n2)  Hadith of the Slave girl\n\nThe Hadith of Muawiya ibn al-Hakam: He (the Holy Prophet) said: Bring her to me. So I brought her to him. He said to her: Where is Allah? She said: He is in the heaven(fi al sama') He said: Who am I? She said: Thou art the Messenger of Allah. He said: Grant her freedom, she is a believing woman. (Muslim: Book 4, Hadith# 1094)\n\nFrom this hadith they conclusively derive that ALLAH is literally in the sky as it is approved by Prophet (Peace be upon him) himself thus they make it part of their aqida and whosoever differs to them becomes a bidati/Jahimi etc… However their reasoning is not only false but also idiotic. Let’s see how\n\n \n\na) First of all the hadith is only ahad (singular and cannot be used for aqida) with this chain of narrators\n\n\nb) Secondly, there are overwhelming Quranic verses and hadiths with multiple chains of narrators which if taken literally prove their understanding false therefore even if the classification of hadith as ahad is not accepted still the hadith cannot be taken literally at any cost. [Note: This rule will also apply to other verses and ahadith which salafis take literally too]\n\n\nc) Thirdly, in Sharh of this hadith Imam an Nawawi (rah) the leading commentator of Sahih Muslim has given figurative explanation (according to Literalists the Ash'aris are Ahlul Bidah for giving figurative explanation, so this false fatwa of them applies on Imam Nawawi too, let alone Ibn Hajr al Asqalani and many other great scholars)\n\n \n\n**Proof for (a) i.e. Hadith is ahad**\n\nThis version (where is Allah, in the sky) only comes from Muwaiya ibn al Hakam (ra) via the route of At'a bin Yassar thus is therefore ahad, It is fundamental principle that “AHAD NARRATIONS” cannot be taken as conclusive proof over “Aqida issues”\n\n\n**Proof for (b) i.e. Ayahs and sahih ahadith which if taken literally will prove the above wording of hadith completely false**\n\n\n\nQuran states: It was We Who created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein.(50:16)\n\nOur dear Salafis turn towards figurative explanation of ALLAH's closeness and say He is close \"By his knowledge only\" and they run towards aqwaal of different ulama on this (i.e. hypocrisy in simple words)\n\n \n\n\n\n\nQuran states: To Allah belong the east and the West: \"WHITHERSOEVER YE TURN, THERE IS PRESENCE OF ALLAH\" For Allah is all-Pervading, all-Knowing.(Yusuf Ali 2:115)\n\n\nThe Literalists will die but never believe ALLAH's presence to be \"Wheresoever we turn\" and they will turn towards figurative interpretation! Please note that word \"WAJH\" has been used here and Wajh in Qur'an when used for Allah refers to his complete Entity, presence, dominion and sultanate.\n\n \n\n \n\nHadith in Sahih Bukhari states: Volume 1, Book 12, Number 720:\n\nNarrated Ibn 'Umar: The Prophet saw expectoration in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque while he was leading the prayer, and scratched it off. After finishing the prayer, he said, \"Whenever any of you is in prayer he should know that Allah is in front of him.So none should spit in front of him in the prayer.\"\n\n\nNote: Ibn Taymiyyah is known to have compared existance of Allah to that of \"moon and sun\" while explaining this hadith i.e Allah azza Wajjal is infront of us just like Sun and Moon come in-front of us (Audhobillah Min Dhalik)\n\n \n\nProof for (c) i.e. Sharh of Imam an-Nawawi (rah) on the same hadith\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nهذا الحديث من أحاديث الصفات , وفيها مذهبان تقدم ذكرهما مرات في كتاب الإيمان . أحدهما : الإيمان به من غير خوض في معناه , مع اعتقاد أن الله تعالى ليس كمثله شيء وتنزيهه عن سمات المخلوقات . والثاني تأويله بما يليق به , فمن قال بهذا قال : كان المراد امتحانها , هل هي موحدة تقر بأن الخالق المدبر الفعال هو الله وحده , وهو الذي إذا دعاه الداعي استقبل السماء كما إذا صلى المصلي استقبل الكعبة ؟ وليس ذلك ; لأنه منحصر في السماء كما أنه ليس منحصرا في جهة الكعبة , بل ذلك لأن السماء قبلة الداعين , كما أن الكعبة قبلة المصلين , أو هي من عبدة الأوثان العابدين للأوثان التي بين أيديهم , فلما قالت : في السماء , علم أنها موحدة وليست عابدة للأوثان.‏\n\n‏\nTranslation: This is one of the \"hadiths of attributes\" and there are two positions about it as it was mentioned in the book of faith, First: is to have faith in it \"Without discussing its meaning, while believing of Allah Most High that \"there is nothing whatsoever like unto Him\"and that He is exalted above having any of the attributes of His creatures. ''The second is to FIGURATIVELY EXPLAIN IT\" in a fitting way, scholars who hold this position adduce that the point of the hadith was to ''test the slave girl : Was she a monotheist\"who affirmed that the Creator, the Disposer, the Doer, is Allah alone and that He is the one called upon when a person making supplication (du'a) faces the sky--just as those performing the prayer (salat) face the Kaaba, since the sky is the qibla of those who supplicate, as the Kaaba is the qibla of those who perform the prayer. or was she a worshipper of the idols which they placed in front of themselves? So when she said, In the sky, it was plain that she was not an idol worshipper(Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, Volume No.5, Page Nos. 19-20, Published by Dar ul Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon)\n\n\nImam Nawawi (rah) continues and gives conclusive answer over this issue, he quotes Imam Qadhi Iyad (rah) [Also Quoted by Imam Jalal ud din Suyuti rah in his Sharh of Sunnan Nasa'i]\n\n\n\nقال القاضي عياض : لا خلاف بين المسلمين قاطبة فقيههم ومحدثهم ومتكلمهم ونظارهم ومقلدهم أن الظواهر الواردة بذكر الله تعالى في السماء كقوله تعالى : { أأمنتم من في السماء أن يخسف بكم الأرض } ونحوه ليست على ظاهرها , بل متأولة عند جميعهم\n\n\nQadhi Iyaad (rah) said: There is no disagreement amongst Muslims whether between Fuqaha, or hadith scholars, the theologians, polemicists and ordinary Muslims who do taqlid, they all say that outward meaning of texts such as Allah is in the sky is not meant, for example the words of the Exalted: “Are you assured that He who is in the sky will not cause the earth to swallow you up?\"THESE AND SIMILAR TEXTS CANNOT BE TAKEN LITERALLY, RATHER THEY ARE TO BE EXPLAINED WITH INTERPRETATION (I.E. TAWEEL) [ibid]\n\n\nThe same great Imam also says in his ''Majmu' sharh al Muhadhab''\n\nThe most well-known of the school of the theologians (mutakallimin) say that the divine attributes are interpreted figuratively according to what befits them.(Volume No. 1, Page No. 25)\n\n\nNote: This is the same great Imam who is author of Kitaab al Adhkar which has been grossly tampered by salafis, I wonder which Islamic text have they spared.\n\n\nThe great Hanafi Imam, Mullah Ali Qari (rah) says in his magnificent Mirqaat Sharh al Mishqaat:\n\n\n\nفقال لها أي للجارية رسول الله أين الله وفي رواية أين ربك أي أين مكان حكمه وأمره وظهور ملكه وقدرته فقالت في السماء قال القاضي هو على معنى الذي جاء أمره ونهيه من قبل السماء لم يرد به السؤال عن المكان فإنه منزه عنه كما هو منزه عن الزمان بل مراده من سؤاله إياها أن يعلم أنها موحدة أو مشركة لأن كفار العرب كانوا يعبدون الأصنام وكان لكل قوم منهم صنم مخصوص يكون فيما بينهم يعبدونه ويعظمونه ولعل سفهاءهم وجهلتهم كانوا لا يعرفون معبودا غيره فأراد أن يتعرف أنها ما تعبد فلما قالت في السماء وفي رواية أشارت إلى السماء فهم أنها موحدة يريد بذلك نفي الآلهة الأرضية التي هي الأصنام لا إثبات السماء مكانا له تعالى الله عما يقول الظالمون علوا كبيرا ولأنه لما كان مأمورا بأن يكلم الناس على قدر عقولهم ويهديهم إلى الحق على حسب فهمهم ووجدها تعتقد أن المستحق للعبودية إله يدبر الأمر من السماء إلى الأرض لا الآلهة التي يعبدها المشركون قنع منها بذلك ولم يكلفها اعتقاد ما هو صرف التوحيد وحقيقة التنزيه وقيل معناه أن أمره ونهيه ورحمته ووحيه جاءت من السماء فهو كقوله تعالى أأمنتم من في السماء تبارك قيل وقد جاء في بعض الأحاديث أن هذه الجارية كانت خرساء ولهذا جوز الشافعي الأخرس في العتق فقوله فقالت في السماء بمعنى أشارت إلى السماء كما في رواية قال شارح الوقاية وجاز الأصم أي من يكون في أذنه وقرأ أما من لم يسمع أصلا فينبغي أن لا يجوز لأنه فائت جنس المنفعة فقال من أنا فقالت أنت رسول الله فقال رسول الله أعتقها أمر إجازة رواه مالك وفي رواية مسلم قال أي معاوية كانت لي جارية ترعى غنما قبل أحد بكسر القاف وفتح الباء أي جانبه وأحد بضمتين جبل معروف في المدينة والجوانية بتشديد الواو وموضع قريب أحد فأطلعت بتشديد الطاء أي أشرفت على الغنم ذات يوم أي يوما من الأيام أو نهارا وذات زائدة فإذا الذئب قد ذهب بشاة من غنمنا إذا للمفاجأة واللام في الذئب للعهدية الذهنية نحو قوله تعالى إذ هما في الغار التوبة وأنا رجل من بني آدم آسف بهمزة ممدودة وفتح سين أي أغضب كما يأسفون لكن أي وأردت أن أضربها ضربا شديدا على ما هو مقتضى الغضب لكن صككتها صكة أي لطمتها لطمة فأتيت رسول الله فعظم بالتشديد والفتح ذلك على أي كبر النبي ذلك الأمر أو الضرب علي وفي نسخة بالتخفيف والضم قلت وفي نسخة فقلت يا رسول الله أفلا أعتقها قال الطيبي رحمه الله فإن قلت كيف التوفيق بين الروايتين قلت الرواية الأولى متضم\n\n\n\nمن هذه اللطمة إعتاقها أفيكفيني إعتاقها للأمرين جميعا والرواية الثانية مطلقة تحتمل الأمرين والمطلق محمول على المقيد ومما يدل على أن السؤال ليس عن مجرد اللطمة سؤال النبي الجارية عن إيمانها ا ه والظاهر أن الإعتاق عن اللطمة مستحب فيندرج في ضمن الإعتاق الواجب فليس من باب تداخل الكفارة كما توهم قال آتيني بها الباء للتعدية أي احضر بها إلي فأتيته بها فقال لها أين الله أي أين المعبود المستحق الموصوف بصفات الكمال قالت في السماء أي كما في الأرض والإقتصار من باب الإكتفاء قال تعالى جل جلاله وهو الذي في السماء إله وفي الأرض إله الزخرف وقال الله عز وجل وهو الله في السموات وفي الأرض الأنعام ويمكن أن يكون الاقتصار لدفع توهم الشركة في العبودية ردا على عبدة الأصنام الأرضية قال من أنا قالت أنت رسول الله قال اعتقها فإنها مؤمنة أي بالله وبرسوله وبما جاء من عندهما وهذا يدل على قبول الإيمان الإجمالي ونفي التكليف الإستدلالي باب اللعان في المغرب لعنه لعنا ولاعنه ملاعنة ولعانا وتلاعنوا لعن بعضهم بعضا وأصله الطرد قال النووي رحمه الله إنما سمى لعانا لأن كلا من الزوجين يبعد عن صاحبه ويحرم النكاح بينهما على التأبيد واللعان عند جمهور أصحابنا يمين وقيل شهادة وقيل يمين فيها شوب شهادة وينبغي أن يكون بحضرة الإمام أو القاضي جمع من المسلمين وهو أحد أنواع التغليظ فإنه يغلظ بالزمان والمكان والجمع قال المحقق ابن الهمام هو مصدر لاعن سماعي لا قياسي والقياس الملاعنة وكثيرا من النحاة يجعلون الفعال والمفاعلة مصدرين قياسيين لفاعل واللعن في اللغة الطرد والإبعاد وفي الفقه اسم يجري بين الزوجين من الشهادات بالألفاظ المعلومات سمى بذلك لوجود لفظ اللعن في الخامسة تسمية للكل باسم الجزء ولم يسم باسم من الغضب وهو أيضا موجود فيها لأنه في كلامها وذاك في كلامه وهو أسبق والسبق من أسباب الترجيح وشرطه قيام النكاح وسببه قذفه زوجته بما يوجب الحد في الأجنبية وحكمه حرمتها بعد التلاعن وأهله من كان أهلا للشهادة فإن اللعان شهادات مؤكدات بالإيمان عندنا وأما عند الشافعي فأيمان مؤكدات بالشهادات وهو الظاهر من قول مالك وأحمد وتمام تحقيقه في شرحه للهداية\n\n\nTranslation: In another version of the same Ḥadīth there is the wording: “Where is your Lord?” It means that where is His place of decision, and His order, and the place where His dominion and power are manifested. {She said: “In the sky”} Imam al-Qadi [‘Iyad] said: “The meaning is that His command and His prohibition comes from the direction of the sky. The Prophet [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] did not mean to ask her about the whereabouts of Allāh, since He transcends such an attribute as place, just as He transcends the attribute of time. Rather, the Prophet [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] intended to find out by his question to her whether she was a monotheist declaring the uniqueness of Allah (muwahhidah), or whether she was a polytheist (mushrikah) because the Arabs were worshipping idols. Each clan amongst them had its special idol, which it worshipped and revered. Perhaps some of their ignorant and stupid people did not recognize any god whatsoever; therefore, the Prophet [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] wanted to ascertain what she worshipped. So when she said “in the sky,” or, as in another version, she pointed to the sky, he [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] understood that she was a monotheist declaring the uniqueness of Allāh. In other words , he wanted to preclude the gods on earth; that is, the idols. He did not mean to imply that He occupies a place in the sky, far-removed is Allāh from what the transgressors ascribe to Him in their insolence. Moreover, the Prophet [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] had been ordered to speak to the people according to the extent of their intelligence, and to guide them to the truth in way which was appropriate to their understanding.\n\n \n\nSo when the Prophet [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] found that she believed that the one who deserves to be worshipped is the God who implements His purpose from the sky to the earth, not the gods which the pagans worshipped, he was satisfied with that much from her, and he [sallallahu alayhi wa sallam] did not charge her with sheer unity (Sirf al-tauḤīd )–the principle of transcendence (Ḥaqīqat al-tanzīh) Some [of the ulamā’] have said that the meaning is that His order and prohibition, His mercy and revelation comes from the sky. In that case, this hadīth is similar [in its implications] to His (Allah's) word: “Do you feel secure from Him who is in the sky…?” Furthermore, in some other [authentic] versions of this Ḥadīth it comes that this girl was dumb, and for that reason [Imām] al-Shafi‘ī [d. 204 / 820; Cairo] permitted the freeing of a slave even if he is dumb. In such case, the words in the Ḥadīth “She said, ‘In the sky.’” mean that she pointed to the sky [since she could not speak, obviously; and this is just what has come expressly in another version of the Ḥadīth: “She pointed to the sky.”] [Mullah Ali Qari in Mirqat Sharh al Mishqaat, Volume No. 6, Page nos. 452-453, Published by Dar ul Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon] \n\n\nNow let's turn towards the Second fundamental proof which Literalists use to justify their anthropomorphism and fool innocent Muslims in believing that Allah is an entity which literally comes down to lowest heaven in the last part of night (Naudhobillah), the hadith which they cite is this\n\n\n3) The Hadith of Descent\n\n\nBook 004, Number 1656: (Sahih Muslim)\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Our Lord, the Blessed and the Exalted, descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the latter part of the night is left, and says: Who supplicates Me so that I may answer him? Who asks Me so that I may give to him? Who asks Me forgiveness so that I may forgive him?\n\n\nBefore Sharh of this hadith is given, one has to understand that Allah is closest to believers not only in the last part of night but everytime! However He has stressed upon being very close at last part of the night so that Muslims strive to do more Ibadah and wake up for Him. Similar metaphorical example is also given in a sahih hadith al Qudsi that If we walk towards Him, He runs towards us! This however does not mean that Allah is actually/literally running towards us.\n\nLet us see the belief of great Hadith Master Imam al-Bayhaqi (rah) and what he had to say about such hadiths.\n\n\n \n\nأخبرنا ابو زكريا بن أبي إسحاق أنا احمد بن سلمان الفقيه نا محمد بن مسلمة نا يزيد بن هارون أنا الحجاج عن يحيى بن أبي كثير عن عروة . «عن عائشة قالت فقدت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ذات ليلة فخرجت أطلبه فإذا هو بالبقيع رافعا رأسه إلى السماء فقال يا عائشة أكنت تخافين ان يحيف الله عليك ورسوله قالت قلت وما بي من ذلك ولكنني ظننت أنك أتيت بعض نسائك فقال إن الله عز وجل ينزل ليلة النصف من شعبان إلى السماء الدنيا فيغفر لأكثر من عدد غنم كلب». قال أحمد وهذا النزول المراد به والله أعلم فعلا سماه الرسول عليه السلام نزولا بلا انتقال ولا زوال او أراد به نزول ملك من ملائكته بأمره وقد ذكرناه في غير هذا الموضع مفسرا .\n\nRegarding descent of Allah in night of Nisf Sha’ban, Imam al-bayhaqi (rah) said:\n\n\n\nTranslation: ...Imam Ahmed (rah i.e. al-Bayhaqi) said: The Nazul, the meaning of this “ALLAH KNOWS” The Prophet (Peace be upon him) mentioned it as an “ACT (NOT ESSENCE OF ALLAH HIMSELF)” and this descent is “WITHOUT MOVING FROM ONCE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND WITHOUT ZAWAAL” or the Prophet meant by this that “ANGEL FROM ANGELS DESCENDS WITH AN ORDER” we have mentioned it in detail at other place\n\n[Imam al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab ul Imaan Hadith # 3826]\n\n \n\nMullah Ali Qari (rah) said of this hadith:\n\n\nYou know that Imam Malik and al-Awazai, who are among the greatest of the early Muslims, both gave detailed figurative interpretations to the hadith, Another of them was Jafar al-Sadiq. Indeed a whole group of them [the early Muslims], as well as later scholars, said that whoever believes Allah to be in a particular physical direction is an unbeliever, as al-Iraqi has explicitly stated, saying that this was the position of Abu Hanifa, Malik, al-Shafi'i, al-Ashari, and al- Baqillani (Mirqat al-mafatih: sharh Mishkat al-masabih. 5 vols. Cairo 1309/1892. Reprint. Beirut: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi, n.d., 2.137)\n\n\nIn Sharh of this hadith Imam Nawawi (rah) also quotes Imam Malik (rah) and Awazai (rah) the great Imams of our Islaaf who proved that such hadiths should be ''figuratively'' interpreted. Imam Nawawi (rah) said:\n\n\nتأويل مالك بن أنس وغيره معناه تنزل رحمته وأمره وملائكته، كما قال: فعل السلطان: كذا إذا فعله أتباعه بأمره. والثاني: أنه على إِلاستعارة ومعناه الإقبال على الداعين بالإجابة واللطف والله أعلم\n\n\nTranslation: Imam Malik bin Anas (rah) and others (including Imam Awzai) interpreted it by saying : [\"your Lord descends\"] means \"His mercy, command, and angels descend,\" just as it is said, \"The sultan did such-and-such,\" when his followers did it at his command.( تنزل رحمته وأمره وملائكته كما يقال : فعل السلطان كذا إذا فعله أتباعه بأمره) The second is that it is a ''METAPHOR (الاستعارة )\" signifying [Allah's] concern for those making supplication, by answering them and kindness toward them (Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, Volume No. 6, Page No.31, Published by Dar ul Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon).\n\n\nNo acceptance by Imam Nawawi that Allah literally comes down (Naudhobillah) to the lowest heaven as falsely asserted by salafis.\n\n\nTo read more on hadiths in regards to \"Descent\" this following article by Shaykh, Dr. Gibril.F.Haddad is a must: http://www.sunnah.org/aqida/haddad/Allah%27s%20Descent1.htm\n\n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (rah) says in his Fath al Bari\n\n\n\nقوله : ( ينزل ربنا إلى السماء الدنيا ) ‏\nاستدل به من أثبت الجهة وقال : هي جهة العلو , وأنكر ذلك الجمهور لأن القول بذلك يفضي إلى التحيز تعالى الله عن ذلك .\n\n\nTranslation: Those who ''assert direction'' for Allah have used this hadith as proof that He is in the direction of above-ness(uluww). The vast majority of the scholars reject this, because saying such leads to establishing boundaries for Him and Allah is exalted above that.[Fath ul Bari Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari, Volume No.3, Page No. 338 - Dar ul Fikr]\n\n\nIbn Baz the famous Salafi scholar gave a weird explanation to Imam Ibn Hajr’s quote by saying:\n\n\nذلك الجمهور قال العلامة بن باز حفظه الله مراده بالجمهور أهل الكلام وأما أهل السنة وهم الصحابة رضي الله عنهم ومن تبعهم بإحسان فإنهم يثبتون لله الجهة وهي جهة العلو ويؤمنون بأنه سبحانه فوق العرش بلا\nتمثيلولاتكييف والأدلة على ذلك من الكتاب والسنة أكثر من أن تحصر فتنبه واحذر والله أعلم\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Baz says: What he means by \"the vast majority of the scholars\" is the vast majority of the scholars of kalam. As for Ahl al-Sunna -- and these are the Companions and those who followed them in excellence – they assert a direction for Allah, and that is the direction of elevation, believing that the Exalted is above the Throne without giving an example and without entering into modality. The proofs from the Qur'an and the Sunna for this are innumerable, so take heed and beware. And Allah knows best. [Fath ul Bari with forgeries added by Bin Baaz, Published by Maktaba al Asriyyah, Beirut, Lebanon]\n\n\nAudhobillah min Dhalik, However let's see forward in the same passage what Imam Ibn Hajr has actually said and who he has quoted to conclude this issue, he has given detailed figurative explanation in light of other ahadith that it refers to Allah “Sending down (yunzilu) mercy and angel rather than He descending himself (yanzilu) and nowhere has he said that Ahlus Sunnah, companions and Islaaf pointed direction towards Allah.\n\nImam Ibn Hajr writes:\n\nفمنهم من حمله على ظاهره وحقيقته وهم المشبهة تعالى الله عن قولهم\n\n\nTranslation: Some say that the ''Literal meaning is meant in true sense'': these are the Mushabbiha (Those who resemble Allah to a body) and Allah is exalted above what they say.\n\n\nThen he also wrote:\n\n\nومنهم من أجراه على ما ورد مؤمنا به على طريق الإجمال منزها الله تعالى عن الكيفية والتشبيه وهم جمهور السلف , ونقله البيهقي وغيره عن الأئمة الأربعة والسفيانين والحمادين والأوزاعي والليث وغيرهم\n\n\nTranslation: Some have taken them as they have come, believing in them without specificity, declaring Allah to be transcendent above modality(kayfiyya) and likeness to creation (tashbih): these are the vast majority of the Salaf. That position is reported by Bayhaqi and others from the Four Imams, Sufyan ibn `Uyayna, Sufyan al-Thawri, Hammad ibn Salama, Hammad ibn Zayd, al-Awza`i, al-Layth, and others.\n\n\nIbn Hajr al Asqalani (rah) continues\n\nوقال ابن العربي : حكي عن المبتدعة رد هذه الأحاديث , وعن السلف إمرارها , وعن قوم تأويلها وبه أقول . فأما قوله ينزل فهو راجع إلى أفعاله لا إلى ذاته , بل ذلك عبارة عن ملكه الذي ينزل بأمره ونهيه , والنزول كما يكون في الأجسام يكون في المعاني , فإن حملته في الحديث على الحسي فتلك صفة الملك المبعوث بذلك , وإن حملته على المعنوي بمعنى أنه لم يفعل ثم فعل فيسمى ذلك نزولا عن مرتبة إلى مرتبة , فهي عربية صحيحة انتهى . والحاصل أنه تأوله بوجهين : إما بأن المعنى ينزل أمره أو الملك بأمره , وإما بأنه استعارة بمعنى التلطف بالداعين والإجابة لهم ونحوه\n\nTranslation: Imam(Abu Bakr) Ibn al-`Arabi(rah) said: \"It is reported that the innovators have rejected these hadiths, the Salaf let them pass as they came, and others interpreted them, and my position is the last one. The saying: \"He descends\" refers to His acts not His essence, indeed it is an expression for His angels who descend with His command and His prohibition. And just as descent can concern bodies, it can also concern ideas or spiritual notions (ma`ani). If one takes the hadith to refer to a physical occurrence, then descent would be the attribute of the angel sent to carry out an order. If one takes it to refer to a spiritual occurrence, that is, first He did not act, then He acted: this would be called a descent from one rank to another, and this is a sound Arabic meaning.\" In sum it is interpreted in two ways: the first is: His command or His angel descends; the second is: it is a metaphor for His regard for supplicants, His answering them, and so forth.\n\n\nوقد حكى أبو بكر بن فورك أن بعض المشايخ ضبطه بضم أوله على حذف المفعول أي ينزل ملكا , ويقويه ما رواه النسائي من طريق الأغر عن أبي هريرة وأبي سعيد بلفظ \" إن الله يمهل حتى يمضي شطر الليل , ثم يأمر مناديا يقول : هل من داع فيستجاب له \" الحديث . وفي حديث عثمان بن أبي العاص \" ينادي مناد هل من داع يستجاب له \" الحديث . قال القرطبي : وبهذا يرتفع الإشكال , ولا يعكر عليه ما في رواية رفاعة الجهني \" ينزل الله إلى السماء الدنيا فيقول : لا أسأل عن عبادي غيري \" لأنه ليس في ذلك ما يدفع التأويل المذكور\n\n\nTranslation: Abu Bakr ibn Furak said: Some of the masters have read it yunzilu (He sends down) instead of yanzilu (He descends), that is: He sends down an angel. This is strengthened by Nisa'i's narration through al-Aghurr from Abu Hurayra and Abu Sa`id al-Khudri: \"Allah waits until the first part of the night is over, then He orders a herald to say: Is there anyone supplicating so that he may be answered?...\"There is also the hadith of `Uthman ibn Abi al-`As: \"The gates of heaven are opened (in the middle) of the night and a herald calls out: Is there anyone supplicating so that he may be answered?...\" Al-Qurtubi said: \"This clears all ambiguity, and there is no interference by the narration of Rufa`at al-Jahni whereby \"Allah descends to the nearest heaven and says: No-one other than I asks about My servants\" for there is nothing in this which precludes the above-mentioned interpretation. [Fath ul Bari, 3:339 - Dar ul Fikr]\n\n\nوقال البيضاوي : ولما ثبت بالقواطع أنه سبحانه منزه عن الجسمية والتحيز امتنع عليه النزول على معنى الانتقال من موضع إلى موضع أخفض منه , فالمراد نور رحمته , أي ينتقل من مقتضى صفة الجلال التي تقتضي الغضب والانتقام إلى مقتضى صفة الإكرام التي تقتضي الرأفة والرحمة\n\n\nTranslation: Al-Baydawi said:\"Since it is established with decisive proofs that the Exalted is transcendent above having a body or being circumscribed by boundaries, it is forbidden to attribute to Him descent in the sense of displacement from one place to another place lower than it. What is meant is the light of His mercy: that is, He moves from what is pursuant to the attribute of Majesty entailing wrath and punishment, to what is pursuant to the attribute of Generosity entailing kindness and mercy.\"\"[ibid]\n\n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (rah) also states in his Fath al Bari that:\n\nقال ابن المنير : جميع الأحاديث في هذه الترجمة مطابقة لها إلا حديث ابن عباس فليس فيه إلا قوله \" رب العرش \" ومطابقته والله أعلم من جهة أنه نبه على بطلان قول من أثبت الجهة أخذا من قوله ( ذي المعارج ) ففهم أن العلو الفوقي مضاف إلى الله تعالى , فبين المصنف أن الجهة التي يصدق عليها أنها سماء والجهة التي يصدق عليها أنها عرش كل منهما مخلوق مربوب محدث , وقد كان الله قبل ذلك وغيره , فحدثت هذه الأمكنة , وقدمه يحيل وصفه بالتحيز فيها والله أعلم\n\n\nTranslation: And by including the hadith of Ibn `Abbas containing the words: \"Lord of the mighty Throne\" into this chapter, Bukhari warned those that might predicate spatial elevation to Allah (`uluw fawqi) that both the direction in which the heaven is believed to be and that in which the Throne is believed to be are created, lorded over, and brought into existence by Allah Who existed before all that and before everything else. Thus these places were created, and his existence, being eternal without beginning, precludes reference to him as being bounded by them. And Allah knows best.\n\n \n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (rah) explains in his Fath al Bari again\n\nوقيل مناسبة التسبيح في الأماكن المنخفضة من جهة أن التسبيح هو التنزيه فناسب تنزيه الله عن صفات الانخفاض كما ناسب تكبيره عند الأماكن المرتفعة , ولا يلزم من كون جهتي العلو والسفل محال على الله أن لا يوصف بالعلو لأن وصفه بالعلو من جهة المعنى والمستحيل كون ذلك من جهة الحس\n\n\nTranslation: The reality that the two directions of \"above\" and \"below\" are impossible for Allah but it does not mean that he cannot be described with the attribute of elevation (`uluw), for such description is only to denote highness, not that of sensory perception (Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bari 6:240 - Kitab ul Jihad, Published by Dar ul Fikr)\n\n\n \n\n4) The Book over the throne\n\nVolume 9, Book 93, Number 643: (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\n\nI heard Allah's Apostle saying, \"Before Allah created the creations, He wrote a Book (wherein He has written): My Mercy has preceded my Anger.\" and that (Book) is written with Him over the Throne.\"\n\nFirst of all ''With him'' refers to position of rank and definitely not location, because locations can never apply to him, if directed towards him then it contradicts the clear message in Surat al Ikhlaas and verses like \"there is nothing whatsoever like unto Him\" (Qur'an 42:11)\n\n\nImam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani (rah) explains in his Fath al Bari\n\nإذا حملوه , وإن كان حامل العرش وحامل حملته هو الله , وليس قولنا إن الله على العرش أي مماس له أو متمكن فيه أو متحيز في جهة من جهاته بل هو خبر جاء به التوقيف , فقلنا له به ونفينا عنه التكييف إذ ليس كمثله شيء وبالله التوفيق . وقوله \" فوق عرشه \" صفة الكتاب , وقيل إن فوق هنا بمعنى دون , كما جاء في قوله تعالى ( بعوضة فما فوقها ) وهو بعيد , وقال ابن أبي جمرة يؤخذ من كون الكتاب المذكور فوق العرش أن الحكمة اقتضت أن يكون العرش حاملا لما شاء الله من أثر حكمة الله وقدرته وغامض غيبه ليستأثر هو بذلك من طريق العلم والإحاطة , فيكون من أكبر الأدلة على انفراده بعلم الغيب , قال : وقد يكون ذلك تفسيرا لقوله ( الرحمن على العرش استوى ) أي ما شاءه من قدرته وهو كتابه الذي وضعه فوق العرش\n\n\nTranslation: When we say: \"Allah is above the Throne\" (Allah `ala al-`arsh), it does not mean that He is touching it or that He is located on it or bounded by a certain side of the Throne. Rather, it is a report which is transmitted as is, and so we repeat it while at the same time negating any modality for there is nothing like Him whatsoever, and from Him is all success. As for \"over His throne\" (in the hadith) it refers to the Book. Some have taken it in the sense of \"upwards from His Throne,\" as in Allah's saying: \"a gnat, or anything above it\" (2:26), but this is far-fetched. Ibn Abu Jamra (d. 695) said: \"It may be said from the fact that the Book is mentioned as being \"above the Throne\" that the divine wisdom has decreed for the Throne to carry whatever Allah wishes of the record of His judgment, power, and the absolute unseen known of Him alone, so as to signify the exclusivity of His encompassing knowledge regarding these matters, making the Throne one of the greatest signs of the exclusivity of His knowledge of the Unseen. This could explain the verse al-rahmanu `al al-`arshi istawa as referring to whatever Allah wills of His power, which is the Book He has placed above His Throne.\" [Fath ul Bari, 15:371 - Dar ul Fikr]\n\nNow these were the proofs in light of leading Commentators of Bukhari and Muslim (i.e. Imam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani - Rahimuhullah and Imam Nawawi - Rahimuhullah), plus the greatest Seerah Author i.e. Imam Qadhi Iyaad (rah), The expert in theology/hadith i.e. Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Arabi (rah) and many others!\n\n.\n\nWe would like to conclude with the explanation of Imam Bukhari (Rahimuhullah) himself on \"WAJH (FACE)\" of Allah, according to Salafis all such attributes are to be taken literally and giving Taweel on any of them makes the person as Jahimi, now let us see if Salafis are true to their words.\n\n.\n\n\n28 ـ سورة الْقَصَصِ\n\n.\n\n \n\n \n\n‏{‏كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ‏}‏ إِلاَّ مُلْكَهُ، وَيُقَالُ إِلاَّ مَا أُرِيدَ بِهِ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ‏.‏ وَقَالَ مُجَاهِدٌ ‏{‏الأَنْبَاءُ‏}‏ الْحُجَجُ‏.\n\n.\n\nhttp://www.al-eman.com/hadeeth/viewchp.asp?BID=13&CID=139&SW=????-?????#SR1\n\n.\n\nImam Bukhari (rah) interpreted “Wajh (Face)” as \"DOMINION OF ALLAH\" [Sahih Bukhari, Kitab at-Tafseer]\n\n \n\n\n\n.\n\nSo we ask Salafis whether Imam Bukhari (rah) was a Jahimi/Bidati? And remember we have not diverted from topic because Salafis put all attributes of Allah in the same category and take them all literally, refutation of Salafis on false interpretation of one attribute is refutation of whole Salafi sect.\n\n\n\nLiteralism is a Fitnah which had to be confronted and these Imams did a perfect job.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShare\n \nPowered by Joomla!. valid XHTML and CSS."},

          {text: "This is a very detailed and informative article about the Ahlus Sunnah understanding of the attributes of Allah, specifically addressing the issues of \"Istawa\" (establishment) and \"Nazul\" (descent). \n\nIt's important to note that the article is written from a specific perspective within Ahlus Sunnah, and it criticizes the Salafis for their literal interpretations of these concepts. \n\nHere are some key points from the article:\n\n* **Istawa:** The article argues that the verse about Allah's \"Istawa\" on the Throne (7:54) should be understood figuratively, not literally. It criticizes Salafis for fabricating translations of Tafsir Ibn Kathir to support their literal interpretation.\n* **Hadith of the Slave Girl:** The article points out that the hadith about the slave girl who said Allah is in the sky is a weak hadith (ahad) and cannot be used as a basis for belief. It also highlights the figurative interpretations of this hadith by Imam Nawawi and other scholars.\n* **Hadith of Descent:** The article argues that the hadith about Allah's descent to the lowest heaven should also be understood figuratively, as a metaphor for Allah's mercy and closeness to believers. It cites the interpretations of Imam al-Bayhaqi, Mullah Ali Qari, and Imam Nawawi, who all reject a literal interpretation.\n* **Book over the Throne:** The article explains that the hadith about the Book being \"with Allah\" over the Throne refers to Allah's rank and power, not a physical location. It cites Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani's interpretation of this hadith.\n* **Wajh (Face):** The article points out that Imam Bukhari himself interpreted \"Wajh\" as \"dominion\" and not a literal face, challenging the Salafis' claim that all attributes of Allah should be taken literally.\n\n**Overall, the article presents a strong case for the Ahlus Sunnah understanding of Allah's attributes, emphasizing the importance of figurative interpretation and rejecting literalism.**\n\n**It's important to remember that:**\n\n* **This is just one perspective within Ahlus Sunnah:** There are other interpretations and schools of thought within Ahlus Sunnah.\n* **It's crucial to consult with qualified scholars:**  This article provides valuable insights, but it's essential to seek guidance from knowledgeable Imams and scholars for a deeper understanding of these complex issues.\n\nIf you have any further questions or want to explore specific points in more detail, feel free to ask. \n"},

Proofs shall be given in light of Qur'an, Sahih Hadiths and great explanations of Classical scholars in order to satisfy those who deny sight of Allah .\n\n\n\n\nNote: Before we continue and write over this article, it is important to clarify that the article is placed in \"Main Menu\" section of this website because It has to do with Tawhid. It has great relevance to creed because Qur'an puts forward a challenge to disbelievers in Surah an-Najm and then right after Verse # 18 Allah mentions the false gods revered supremely by Mushrikeen of Makkah i.e. al-Laat, al-Uzza. and Manaat (the three top most false deities of Mushrikeen of Makkah at that time). Thus our Prophet of Mercy (Peace be upon him) seeing Allah is a testimony to Tawhid in front of the Mushrikeen. [See Qur'an 53:17-22].\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis topic is amongst those issues over which even Sahaba have differed within themselves, so we know that some ignorant people (Muslims and even non-Muslims) might dispute over this by saying: Did the Sahaba differ on concepts of Belief?\n\n \n\nThe answer to them is that there are certain aqida issues which are Qat'i/Absolute (like belief in Oneness of ALLAH, Belief in Prophets, Angels, Scriptures, day of judgement, Al-Qadr, Completion of Qur'an and etc... ) over which there is no room for difference, whereas there are others which are Zanni/flexible (such as Belief in allegorical verses, whether to take literal or metaphorical meanings of Istawa, Nazul, Yad-Ullah etc... belief in sight of Allah etc...).\n\n \n\nAlthough the correct opinion is indeed of Ahlus Sunnah that such attributes of Lord Almighty are to be taken as they are without interpretation, rather at times metaphorical explanation becomes necessary, still If someone rejects the metaphorical explanation then such a person will not become Kafir until or unless he/she gives a very lay-person literal explanation like some extremest Salafis do when they say absurd things like Allah is touching the throne, Allah comes down \"in person\" to the lowest heaven in mid part of the night, Allah has 2 SHINS (LEGS),  Allah has a shadow or He literally does jogging (hard to believe but to the amazement of our readers these weird concepts are attested by top notch authorities of Salafi sect including Muhsin Khan the official translator of Qur'an by Saudi kingdom and their giant Muftis like Ibn Uthaymeen, Bin Baaz and Company)\n\n \n\n\nDid Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) see Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) on the night of ascension?\n\n \n\n\n\nThis article shall have abundant proofs from Qur'an but first we would like to reveal to the world a false translation of hadith in Sahih Muslim. Many people read translation of this hadith and start believing that it was actually what Prophet (Peace be upon him) said without verifying the original Arabic and how Muhaditheen read the word \"أَنَّى \"\n\n \n\n \n\nFalse Translation of hadith in Sahih Muslim\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBook 1, Number 0341: (Sahih Muslim - online version)\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr : I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Did you see thy Lord? He said: He is a Light, how could I see Him?\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNext Hadith:\n\n \n\n \n\nBook 1, Number 0342: (Sahih Muslim - online version)\n\n \n\nAbdullah b. Shaqiq reported: I said to Abu Dharr: Had I seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him. He (Abu Dharr) said: What is that thing that you wanted to inquire of him ? He said: I wanted to ask him whether he had seen his Lord. Abu Dharr said: I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: I saw Light.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFirst one (#0341) is a severely false translation. If we accept it on face value then the very next hadith (#0342) will contradict the previous one. Remember Imam Muslim (rah) was an expert in hadith sciences let alone he not knowing that he has narrated 2 totally contradicting hadiths adjacent to each other in his magnificent Sahih collection.\n\n \n\nFalse translation of first hadith (#0341) states: “:He is a Light, how could I see Him?\n\n \n\nHere the translation claims that Allah is a light so how could He be seen?!\n\n \n\nNow the next hadith (#0342) says: \"I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: “I SAW LIGHT”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLet us now move towards the Arabic of first hadith which actually proves without doubt that Prophet (Peace be upon him) actually said that \"He saw Allah\"\n\n \n\nحدّثنا أَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ : حَدَّثَنَا وَكِيعٌ عَنْ يَزِيدَ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَنْ قَتَادَةَ عَنْ عَبْدِ اللّهِ بْنِ شَقِيقٍ عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ ، قَالَ: سَأَلْتُ رَسُولَ اللّهِ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ رَبَّكَ؟ قَالَ: «نُورٌ انى أَرَاهُ»؟.\n\n \n\nTranslation of Matn: Narrated by Abu Dharr (RA): I asked the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him): Did you see your Lord? The Prophet (Peace be upon him) replied: He is Nur (نُورٌ) I Saw Him ( انى أَرَاهُ) [Sahih Muslim, Hadith # 351, Hadith number from Sharh Sahih Muslim by Allama Ghulam Rasool Sa’eedi – Damat Barkatahum Alia]\n\n \n\n\nThis is the perfect translation which actually proves that Prophet (Peace be upon him) did indeed see Allah.\n\n \n\nWe will show word by word translation over here:\n\n \n\nنُورٌ =    He is light\n\nانى =    I, me, myself\n\nأَرَاهُ =    saw Him\n\n \n\nHowever if we do not take this translation then Sahih Muslim will contradict itself as right in the next hadith it says:\n\n \n\nرَأَيْتُ نُوراً = I saw Light (i.e. for Sure I saw Allah)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIn Light of Qur'an\n\n\n \n\n\n\nوَهُوَ بِالْأُفُقِ الْأَعْلَىٰ  ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ  فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ  فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ مَا أَوْحَىٰ  مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَ‌أَىٰ  أَفَتُمَارُ‌ونَهُ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَ‌ىٰ\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTranslation: (7): While he was in the highest part of the horizon.(8): Then he approached and came closer (9): And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer. (10): So did (Allah) convey the inspiration to His Servant- (conveyed) what He (meant) to convey. (11): The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw. (12): Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw? [Al Qur'an, Chapter 53, Verse 7-12]\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the 12th verse our Lord Almighty is challenging the whole world that “WILL YE THEN DISPUTE WITH HIM CONCERNING WHAT HE SAW”, had it been seeing Gabriel only then that would not have been a great challenge because previous Prophets like Musa Kaleem-Ullah (Peace be upon him) had the privilege to talk “DIRECTLY WITH ALLAH” and Ibrahim (alaih salam) was shown the kingdoms of Heaven which was a far superior thing than seeing Gabriel, hence from Nass of Qur'an it now becomes established that vision of Allah was finally reserved for Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) as hadith of Ibn Abbas (RA) and many others prove it (Which shall come in the hadith section of this article)\n\n \n\n \n\nLet us see the detailed Tafsir of these verses by Imam Ibn-ul-Jawzi (rah),  he explains the 8th and 9th verses in light of Sahih ahadith and Aqwaal\n\n \n\n\nوفي المشار إليه بقوله: «ثُمَّ دنا» ثلاثة أقوال.\n\nأحدها: أنه الله عز وجل. روى البخاري ومسلم في «الصحيحين» من حديث شريك بن أبي نَمِر عن أنس بن مالك قال: دنا الجبّار ربُّ العِزَّة فتدلَّى حتى كان منه قابَ قوسين أو أدنى. وروى أبو سلمة عن ابن عباس: «ثم دنا» قال: دنا ربُّه فتدلَّى، وهذا اختيار مقاتل. قال: دنا الرَّبُّ من محمد ليلةَ أُسْرِي به،، فكان منه قابَ قوسين أو أدنى. وقد كشفتُ هذا الوجه في كتاب «المُغْني» وبيَّنتُ أنه ليس كما يخطُر بالبال من قُرب الأجسام وقطع المسافة، لأن ذلك يختص بالأجسام، والله منزَّه عن ذلك.\n\nوالثاني: أنه محمد دنا من ربِّه، قاله ابن عباس، والقرظي.\n\nوالثالث: أنه جبريل. ثم في الكلام قولان.\n\n\n \n\nTranslation: There are three famous sayings regarding the saying of Allah i.e. Then he approached and came closer\n\n\n \n\nFirst: That is Allah Azza wajjal as it is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim in “Sahihayn” the hadith from Sharik bin Abi Numayr who heard from Anas bin Malik (ra) who said: The Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till He was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer [Sahih Bukhari Hadith # 7518, Sahih Muslim Hadith # 162]\n\n \n\n...and It is narrated by Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas (ra) that {He approached} refers to Allah coming near, this is adopted by Maqatil (rah) who said: Allah came near to Muhammad (Peace be upon him) on the night of Isra And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer, however It is written in the book Al Mughni that this coming nearer does not refer to coming closer in sense of bodies nor distance as that is the case with bodily creations and Allah is High of such thing being attributed to him.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Second: That It was Muhammad (Peace be upon him) who went near Allah, this is said by Ibn Abbas (ra) and Qurzi(ra) too.\n\n\n \n\nThe Third: It was Gibril and there is Kalaam in this Qawl.. (Then Ibn Jawzi shows the opinion of Sahaba like Sayyidah Aisha - RA who were of the opinion that Prophet - Peace be upon him did not see Allah, why Sayyidah Aisha - RA believed such and how other Sahaba differed with her shall be explained in detail Insha'Allah)\n\n \n\nReference: Imam Ibn Jawzi in Zad al Maseer fi Ilm at Tafsir, Volume No. 8, Page No. 65-66\n\n \n\nHence From Qur'an and Sahih hadiths of Bukhari and Muslim which give best sharh of 8th and 9th verses It is proven that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah (Anas bin Malik R.A who is claimed to have rejected sight of Allah is proving in these ahadith that Prophet - Peace be upon him did see Allah, It is fundamental Usool of Hadith that If same sahabi says 2 contrary things then “Masbat (proof)” takes over “Nafi (i.e. rejection)”, so according to this Usool itself it is soundly established that the Prophet Peace be upon him did indeed see Allah and the Nafi of this has to be rejected)\n\n \n\nQur'an states at another place:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nوَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِيۤ أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَـٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ\n\n \n\nمَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي فَلَمَّا\n\n \n\nتَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكّاً وَخَرَّ موسَىٰ صَعِقاً فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِي\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: And when Musa (Moses) came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord (Allah) spoke to him; he said: \"O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.\" Allah said: \"You cannot see Me (Qur'an states: LAN TARANI NOT LAN URA), but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.\" So when his Lord appeared to the mountain , He made it collapse to dust, and Musa (Moses) fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.\"[Al Qur'an, Surah 7, Verse no 143]\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the world renowned Tafsir al Jalalyn (written by 2 great scholars Imam Jalal ud-din Suyuti and Imam al-Muhalli) it states:\n\n \n\n\n\nأَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَٰنِى } أي لا تقدر على رؤيتي، والتعبير به دون «لن أُرَى» يفيد إمكان رؤيته تعالى { وَلَٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ } الذي هو أقوى منك { فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ } ثبت { مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَٰنِى } أي تثبت لرؤيتي، وإلا فلا طاقة لك { فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ } أي ظهر من نوره قدر نصف أنملة الخنصر كما في حديث صححه الحاكم\n\n\nTranslation: {You shall not see Me},which means you do not have the capability to see me THE USE OF THE WORDING (LAN TARANI) RATHER THAN LAN URA (I.E. I SHALL NOT BE SEEN) IMPLIES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE ALLAH {But gaze at the mountain} which is stronger than you are, {And if it stands still in its place} then you shall see Me’, that is, [then] you shall remain fixed [able] to see Me, otherwise, you will not have the capacity [for it]. {And when his Lord revealed (His) glory to the mountain} i.e. When he manifested his light, equivalent to half a nail of little finger as this is mentioned in the sahih hadith of Hakim\n\n \n\nReference: Tafsir al Jalalyn, Page No. 167, Published by Dar Ibn Kathir, Damascus\n\n \n\nIn the Ayah Musa (a.s) said in the end: And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.\"(7:143)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTafsir ul Qurtubi\n\n\n\nImam al-Qurtubi (rah) explains it as:\n\n\nوأجمعت الأمة على أن هذه التوبة ما كانت عن معصية؛ فإن الأنبياء معصومون. وأيضاً عند أهل السنة والجماعة الرؤيةُ جائزةٌ.\n\n\nTranslation: The Imams are unanimous that (Musa a.s) asking for Tawba does not refer to sins because the Anbiya are infallible/Masoom, and in the opinion of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jammah the Sight of (Allah) is possible\n\n \n\nReference: Tafsir-ul-Qurtubi, Under 7:143\n\n \n\nHence it is decisively proven from Qur'an itself that Anbiya never ask for something Impossible, had sight of Allah not been possible then Musa (a.s) would not have asked for it and nor would have Allah linked it to the condition of mountain staying at its place. So the Vision was reserved only for Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) and not for Musa (alaih salam)\n\n \n\n\nIn Light of Hadith\n\n \n\n\nWe have Qawl of Ummul Momineen (Mother of All Believers) Hadrat Ayesha Saddiqa R.A and Verdict of leading authority over Tafsir of Qur'an amongst Sahaba i.e. Ibn Abbas R.A  who differed with Sayyidah Ayesha r.a in this regard. This difference has been wrongly understood by Salafis whereas in reality the rejection of Sayyidah Aisha (ra) is of \"IDRAAK (COMPLETE COMPREHENSION OF ALLAH)\" which we Ahlus Sunnah also reject, but rejection of Idraak does not mean Prophet did not see Allah at all.\n\n \n\nSecondly Sayyidah Aisha (ra) was a child when al-Isra Wal Mi'raaj took place, remember it took place in the Meccan period before Hijrah and Sayyidah Aisha (ra) was married to Prophet (Peace be upon him) 1 year \"AFTER HIJRAH\" and the Marriage took place when she was only 6 (consummated when she was 9). Hence Sayyidah Aisha (RA) was less than 4 years of age when incident of Mi'raaj took place, hence the opinion of senior Sahaba shall be taken into account as they understood the incident more properly. We would like to clarify that we accept the valid difference of opinion over this issue but the Istadlal of Wahabiyyah is null and void because they are people of Hawa (desires) and they do not follow a school of Jurisprudence nor do they follow the schools of Ahlus Sunnah called Ash'ari/Maturidi, hence even if they reach a valid opinion It will for sure stand rejected in sight Allah and his Apostle (Peace be upon him)\n\n \n\nBelow is the Sharh of the hadith from Aisha (RA) in words of the great Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (rah) whom the so called \"Muqalid Salafis claim to follow. This is cited by the leading commentator of Bukhari i.e. Imam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (rah)\n\n \n\n \n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (Rahimuhullah) says in his magnificent Fath ul Bari Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari:\n\n\n\nعن المروزي قلت لأحمد إنهم يقولون إن عائشة قالت من زعم أن محمدا رأى ربه فقد أعظم على الله الفرية فبأي شيء يدفع قولها قال بقول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي قول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أكبر من قولها\n\nTranslation: Maruzi (rah) asked Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (rah): People say that Aisha (ra) used to exclaim that whosoever says the Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord has attributed a lie to Allah, so how shall this be answered? (Imam Ahmed) replied: From the saying of Prophet (Peace be upon him) [himself] when he said:  “رأيت ربي” i.e. I saw my Lord, this will be an answer to Aisha (ra)’s Qawl because the saying of Prophet (Peace be upon him) is far superior than saying of her (i.e. Aisha ra)\n\n \n\nReference: Best commentary over Sahih Bukhari called Fath ul Bari, Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari, Volume No. 8, Page No. 494\n\n\n\n \n\nImam an-Nawawi (rah) the leading commentator of Sahih Muslim sheds more light on this, as he explains:\n\n\n\n‏وإذا صحت الروايات عن ابن عباس في إثبات الرؤية وجب المصير إلى إثباتها فإنها ليست مما يدرك بالعقل , ويؤخذ بالظن , وإنما يتلقى بالسماع ولا يستجيز أحد أن يظن بابن عباس أنه تكلم في هذه المسألة بالظن والاجتهاد . وقد قال معمر بن راشد حين ذكر اختلاف عائشة وابن عباس : ما عائشة عندنا بأعلم من ابن عباس , ثم إن ابن عباس أثبت شيئا نفاه والمثبت مقدم على النافي\n\n\nTranslation: When it is proven from Sahih hadiths of Ibn Abbas (ra) then we cannot assume that he said it according to his own assumption, definitely he said this after hearing it from Prophet (Peace be upon him), Ma’mar bin Rashid (rah) said regarding the difference between Aisha (ra) and Ibn Abbas (ra) that Aisha (ra) was not aware about this (completely) whereas Ibn Abbas (ra) was, So when Ibn Abbas (ra) is proving it while some others are doing Nafi of it then It is a (Principle) that Masbat (Proof) takes over Nafi (rejection)\n\n \n\nReference: Sharh Sahih Muslim, Kitab al Iman, Chapter in meaning of :He saw him at the second descent\n\n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 1\n\n \n\nIbn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens (of Taqdir) Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: Return to thy Lord(‏فراجع ربك), for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord(فراجعت ربي) and He remitted a portion out of that. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord(‏راجع ربك),, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord(فراجعت ربي) and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said: I feel ashamed of my Lord(قد استحييت من ربي) [Sahih Muslim, Hadith No. 313 – Agreed upon]\n\nThis hadith decisively proves that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah because every time Musa (a.s) told him to “RETURN TO HIS LORD” and finally the Prophet said: “I FEEL ASHAMED OF MY LORD”\n\n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 2\n\n\n‏ عن ‏ ‏ابن عباس ‏ ‏قال ‏\nرأى ‏ ‏محمد ‏ ‏ربه قلت أليس الله يقول ‏\nلا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار ‏\n\nقال ويحك ذاك إذا تجلى بنوره الذي هو نوره وقال أريه مرتين ‏\nقال ‏ ‏أبو عيسى ‏ ‏هذا ‏ ‏حديث حسن\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Abbas (ra) said that Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord, (Ikrama) asked: Hasn’t Allah said that Eyes cannot “COMPREHEND” him, at this (Ibn Abbas) replied: Strange (Arabic wording is more strict but we have translated it to Strange) that you have not understood, this is when Allah shows glimpse of his own Nur (which cannot be comprehended), so Prophet (Peace be upon him) indeed saw Allah twice\n\n \n\nReference: Sunnan Tirimdh, Tafsir of Surah al-Najm, Hadith No. 3201] – Imam Tirimdhi declared this hadith as “Hassan”\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 3\n\n \n\nSheikh Muhadith Haq Dhelvi (rahimuhullah) writes: Ibn Umar(ra) turned to Ibn Abbas (ra) regarding this matter and asked whether the Prophet (Peace be upon him) has seen his Lord, Ibn Abbas replied in affirmative, Ibn Umar (ra) accepted this and did not reject it [Ashaat ul Lamaat, Volume No. 4, Page No. 431]\n\nNow It is proven from yet another Mujtahid Sahabi i.e. Ibn Umar (ra) that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 4\n\n\nImam Badr ud din Ayni (Rahimuhullah) the commentator of Bukhari said:\n\n\n\nروى ابن خزيمة بإسناد قوي عن أنس قال رأى محمد ربه وبه قال سائر أصحاب ابن عباس وكعب الأحبار والزهري وصاحب معمر وآخرون وحكى عبد الرزاق عن معمر عن الحسن أنه حلف أن محمدا رأى ربه وأخرج ابن خزيمة عن عروة بن الزبير إثباتها\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Khuazaima (rah) narrated with “strong chain” from Anas bin Malik (ra) that he said: Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord, same is narrated from Ibn Abbas (ra) and his disciples like K’ab al Ahbar (ra), Zuhiri (rah) and Ma’mar (rah), Imam Abdur Razzaq (rah) narrates from Ma’mar who quotes Imam Hassan Basri (rah) who used to say: I take an oath that Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wassalam) saw his Lord, Ibn Khuzaima (rah) has also proven it (sight of Allah) from Urwa bin Zubayr (ra) [Umdat al Qari, Sharah Sahih al Bukhari, Volume No. 19, Page No. 198]\n\n \n\nTaking an oath by Imam Hasan al-Basri (rah) is not a minor thing. Those who do not know the standing of Imam Hasan al-Basri (rah) in narrating hadiths does not understand even the basics.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 5\n\n \n\nImam Badr ud din Ayni (rah) also explains:\n\n\n\nوروى الطبراني في (الأوسط) بإسناد قوي عن ابن عباس قال رأى محمد ربه مرتين ومن وجه آخر قال نظر محمد إلى ربه جعل الكلام لموسى والخلة لإبراهيم والنظر لمحمد فظهر من ذلك أن مراد ابن عباس ههنا رؤيا العين\n\n\nTranslation: Imam at-Tabarani (rah) narrates in his (Al Awsat) with “Strong chain” from Ibn Abbas (ra) who said that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord twice, the reason for this saying is that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord with his eyesight, because Musa (a.s) talked to Allah directly, Ibrahim (a.s) was taken as His friend and Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) was chosen for sight (no other Prophet was), apparently what Ibn Abbas (ra) means to say is that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah with his eyes [Umdat al Qari, Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari, Volume No. 17, Page No. 30]\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 6\n\n \n\n\nImam an-Nasai’i (Rahimuhullah) and al-Hakim (Rahimuhullah) narrate with Sahih Isnad:\n\n\n\nأخبرنا إسحاق بن إبراهيم قال أخبرنا معاذ بن هشام قال حدثني أبي عن قتادة عن عكرمة عن بن عباس قال أتعجبون أن تكون الخلة لإبراهيم والكلام لموسى والرؤية لمحمد صلى الله عليه وسلم\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Abbas (ra) narrates: Are you surprised at friendship of Ibrahim (a.s) [with Allah], The Speech of Musa (directly with Allah) and Sight of Muhammad (Salallaho alaihi wasalam)? [Sunnan Nasai’i al Kubra in Amal al Yawm wal Laylah , Volume No.6, Hadith No.11539, Mustadrak ala Sahihayn, Volume No. 1, Hadith No. 216]\n\n \n\n \n\nImam al-Hakim (rah) after narrating it said:\n\nهذا حديث صحيح على شرط البخاري\n\nTranslation: This Hadith is Sahih on the criteria of Bukhari [ibid, Hadith No. 216]\n\n\n \n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (Rahimuhullah) said:\n\n\nما أخرجه النسائي بإسناد صحيح وصححه الحاكم أيضا من طريق عكرمة عن بن عباس قال أتعجبون أن تكون الخلة لإبراهيم والكلام لموسى والرؤية لمحمد\n\n\nTranslation: It is narrated by Nasai’i with “Sahih Isnad” and Hakim also declared it “Sahih” the narration with the chain from Ikrama (rah) who heard Ibn Abbas (ra) say (and he quoted the above hadith) [Fath ul Bari, Sharah Sahih al Bukhari, Volume No. 8, Page No 493]\n\n\n\n\nSo O Muslims do not be surprised after knowing this reality because the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) indeed saw his Lord and this is one of the major differences between us Ahlus Sunnah and misguided Mutazayli sect who used to reject it (today representation of Mutazayli sect is done by Shi'ites)\n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 7\n\n \n\nImam an-Nawawi (Rahimuhullah) writes under the hadith of Ibn Masud (ra) that (Prophet Peace be upon him)’s heart did not lie of what it saw means that he saw Jibril (a.s)\n\n\n\nهذا الذي قاله عبد الله رضي الله عنه هو مذهبه في الآية , وذهب الجمهور من المفسرين إلى أن المراد أنه رأى ربه سبحانه وتعالى\n\n\nTranslation: This is the saying of Abdullah Ibn Masud (ra) and his Madhab, but the Madhab of vast majority of Mufasireen (including Ibn Abbas) is that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’la\n\n \n\nReference:Sharah Sahih Muslim by Imam Nawawi, under Kitab al Iman, The mention of Sidra til Muntaha, Hadith No. 254]\n\n \n\n \n\nImam an-Nawawi further states:\n\n\nفالحاصل أن الراجح عند أكثر العلماء : أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأى ربه بعيني رأسه ليلة الإسراء لحديث ابن عباس وغيره مما تقدم . وإثبات هذا لا يأخذونه إلا بالسماع من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذا مما لا ينبغي أن يتشكك فيه\n\n\nTranslation: The result of all (proofs which have been shown) is that it is pre dominantly established amongst many ulama that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah with his eyes on the night of Ascension as the hadith from Ibn Abbas (ra) and others have been mentioned before, the proof of which comes from Prophet (Peace be upon him) hence there should be no doubt about it [Sharah Sahih Muslim, Kitab al Iman, Chapter in meaning of :He saw him at the second descent]\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nProof # 8\n\n\n\nImam an-Nawawi (rah) also said about Aisha (ra) hadith:\n\n‏فأما احتجاج عائشة بقول الله تعالى : { لا تدركه الأبصار } فجوابه ظاهر , فإن الإدراك هو الإحاطة والله تعالى لا يحاط به , وإذا ورد النص بنفي الإحاطة لا يلزم منه نفي الرؤية بغير إحاطة\n\n\nTranslation: The Proof which Aisha (ra) took (to reject sight of Allah) i.e. {Eyes cannot comprehend him} the apparent answer to this will be that there cannot be Idraak (i.e. complete comprehension, to gather all around, to see all aspects) of Allah, so the Nass (of Quran) does Nafi of Al-Ihaat but this does not do Nafi of sight without Ihaata (i.e. complete comprehension) [Ibid]\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 9\n\n \n\nImam Ibn Jarir (rah) writes under: The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw.

Sayyidah Aisha(ra) rejected it and when Masruq (ra) asked her: O Umm ul Momineen (Mother of believers) did Muhammad (Peace be upon him) see his Lord? She replied: “My hair is standing on end at what you have asked” and she reported it three times “Whosoever told you that has lied. Whoever told you that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord has lied. Then she recited: “The eyes do not comprehend Him but He comprehends (all) vision. He is the Subtle, the Aware (6:103), some people agree with what Aisha (ra) said and it is well known that Ibn Masud (ra) and Abu Hurraira (ra) said similar things, stating that it was Jibril (a.s) he saw. However this is disputed.\n\n\nJamaah (great group) of the hadith scholars, fuqaha and theologians reject this statement and the prohibition on the Prophet of seeing Allah in this world. Ibn Abbas (ra) said: He saw Him with his eyes, while Ata related from him that he saw him with his heart. Abu’l Aliyya said that he saw him with his heart (and mind) twice. Ibn Ishaq mentioned that Ibn Umar (ra) sent to Ibn Abbas (ra) to ask him whether Muhammad (Peace be upon him) had seen his Lord? He replied: “Yes” The best known opinion is that he saw his Lord with his eyes. This is related from him by various paths of transmission. He said that Allah singled out Musa (a.s) for direct speech, Ibrahim (a.s) for close friendship and Muhammad (peace be upon him) for the (direct) vision.\n\n\nThe Proof of it lies in the words of Allah: “The heart (and mind) did not lie about what it saw, What will you dispute with him about what he sees? He saw him another time (53:12-13)\n\nAl-Mawaradi said: It is said that Allah divided his vision and His speech between Musa and Muhammad (Peace be upon them both). Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw Him twice and He spoke to Musa (a.s) twice.\n\nAbul Fath ar-Razi and Abul Layth as-Samarqandi relate this from Ka’b al-Ahbar (rah) and Abdullah ibn al Harith (rah) said that Ibn Abbas and Ka’b agreed on this point. Ibn Abbas (ra) said: As for us, the Banu Hashim, we say that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord twice., Ka’b said: Allah hu Akbar until the mountains echoed him. He further said: Allah divided his vision and speech between Muhammad and Musa (Peace be upon them both)\n\n\nSharik relates that when Abu Dharr (ra) commented on this ayat, he said: “The Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord. Imam Samarqandi [of the Islaaf] relates from Muhammad bin Ka’b al-Qurdhi and Rabi’ Ibn Anas that the Prophet was asked: Have you seen your Lord? He said: I saw Him with my heart, but I did not see him with my eye (Footnote by A: This chain is not authentic and does not reach the Prophet plus it has been established above that Prophet saw Allah with his eyesight, we the Ahlus Sunnah do not fabricate classical literature like Salafis do so our honesty asks us to relate things as they are without altering them). Malik ibn Yukhamir related from Mua’dh bin Jabal that the Prophet said: I saw my Lord and he asked me, Muhammad about what did the higher Assembly disagree [Absolutly sahih hadith on criteria of Bukhari]\n\n\nAbdur Razzaq ibn Hammam [The sheikh of Imam Bukhari, the best ever Muhadith as said by Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal] related that Hassan al Basri [He requires no introduction] used to take an oath (By Allah) that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord.\n\n[End Quote , Ash Shifa by Qadhi Iyaadh, Chapter on \"Sight of Allah\"]\n\n \n\n \n\nAlso see this following Fatwa from Ahlus Sunnah Dar-ul-Ifta\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRendered into English:\n\nQuestion: Did the Prophet (Peace be upon him) see his Lord?

          {text: "This article delves into the complex issue of whether Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) saw Allah during the night of ascension (Isra' and Mi'raj). It presents a strong case for the Ahlus Sunnah belief that he did, citing Quranic verses, Sahih Hadiths, and the interpretations of prominent scholars. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key arguments:\n\n**Quranic Evidence:**\n\n* **Surah An-Najm (53:7-12):** The article highlights the challenge posed by Allah in this Surah, asking if anyone would dispute what the Prophet saw. It argues that this challenge implies a vision of Allah, not just Gabriel, as previous prophets had direct communication with Allah.\n* **Surah Al-A'raf (7:143):** The article points out that Musa (AS) asked to see Allah, and Allah linked it to the mountain's stability. This implies that seeing Allah is possible, but Musa was not granted that vision. \n\n**Hadith Evidence:**\n\n* **Sahih Muslim (Hadith # 351):** The article corrects a common mistranslation of this hadith, showing that the Prophet actually said, \"He is Nur (light), I saw Him.\"\n* **Sahih Muslim (Hadith # 313):** The article highlights the Prophet's repeated return to Allah during the Isra' and Mi'raj, culminating in his statement, \"I feel ashamed of my Lord.\" This implies a direct encounter with Allah.\n* **Sunnan Tirmidhi (Hadith # 3201):** The article cites Ibn Abbas's explanation that the Prophet saw Allah twice, addressing the Quranic verse about eyes not comprehending Allah.\n* **Sahih Bukhari (Hadith # 7518):** The article mentions the hadith about Allah approaching the Prophet, which is supported by other Sahih Hadiths.\n\n**Scholarly Interpretations:**\n\n* **Imam Ibn Jawzi:** The article quotes his Tafsir, which acknowledges the different opinions on the \"approaching\" in Surah An-Najm, but ultimately supports the view that Allah approached the Prophet.\n* **Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani:** The article cites his Fath al-Bari, which emphasizes the Prophet's statement over Aisha's (RA) opinion and highlights the consensus of many scholars on the Prophet's vision of Allah.\n* **Imam an-Nawawi:** The article quotes his Sharh Sahih Muslim, which emphasizes the authority of Ibn Abbas's narration and rejects the idea that Aisha (RA) was more knowledgeable than him.\n* **Imam al-Qurtubi:** The article cites his Tafsir, which states that the consensus of the Ummah is that seeing Allah is possible.\n* **Imam Badr ud din Ayni:** The article quotes his Umdat al Qari, which highlights the strong narrations from Ibn Abbas and other scholars supporting the Prophet's vision of Allah.\n* **Imam an-Nasai'i and al-Hakim:** The article cites their narrations from Ibn Abbas, which emphasize that Allah granted Musa (AS) speech, Ibrahim (AS) friendship, and Muhammad (PBUH) vision.\n* **Qadhi Iyaadh:** The article quotes his Ash-Shifa ash-Shareef, which provides a detailed account of the different opinions on the Prophet's vision of Allah, ultimately supporting the view that he saw Allah with his eyes.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Difference of Opinion:** The article acknowledges that there were differences of opinion among the Sahaba on this issue, particularly between Aisha (RA) and Ibn Abbas (RA).\n* **Ahlus Sunnah Belief:** The article emphasizes that the Ahlus Sunnah belief is that the Prophet saw Allah during the Isra' and Mi'raj.\n* **Figurative Interpretation:** The article emphasizes that while the attributes of Allah are to be taken as they are, figurative interpretations are sometimes necessary to understand them.\n* **Importance of Scholars:** The article stresses the importance of consulting with qualified scholars for a deeper understanding of these complex issues.\n\n**Overall, the article presents a compelling case for the Ahlus Sunnah belief that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) saw Allah during the night of ascension. It provides a wealth of evidence from the Quran, Sahih Hadiths, and the interpretations of prominent scholars.** \n"},

It has great relevance to creed because Qur'an puts forward a challenge to disbelievers in Surah an-Najm and then right after Verse # 18 Allah mentions the false gods revered supremely by Mushrikeen of Makkah i.e. al-Laat, al-Uzza. and Manaat (the three top most false deities of Mushrikeen of Makkah at that time). Thus our Prophet of Mercy (Peace be upon him) seeing Allah is a testimony to Tawhid in front of the Mushrikeen. [See Qur'an 53:17-22].\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis topic is amongst those issues over which even Sahaba have differed within themselves, so we know that some ignorant people (Muslims and even non-Muslims) might dispute over this by saying: Did the Sahaba differ on concepts of Belief?\n\n \n\nThe answer to them is that there are certain aqida issues which are Qat'i/Absolute (like belief in Oneness of ALLAH, Belief in Prophets, Angels, Scriptures, day of judgement, Al-Qadr, Completion of Qur'an and etc... ) over which there is no room for difference, whereas there are others which are Zanni/flexible (such as Belief in allegorical verses, whether to take literal or metaphorical meanings of Istawa, Nazul, Yad-Ullah etc... belief in sight of Allah etc...).\n\n \n\nAlthough the correct opinion is indeed of Ahlus Sunnah that such attributes of Lord Almighty are to be taken as they are without interpretation, rather at times metaphorical explanation becomes necessary, still If someone rejects the metaphorical explanation then such a person will not become Kafir until or unless he/she gives a very lay-person literal explanation like some extremest Salafis do when they say absurd things like Allah is touching the throne, Allah comes down \"in person\" to the lowest heaven in mid part of the night, Allah has 2 SHINS (LEGS),  Allah has a shadow or He literally does jogging (hard to believe but to the amazement of our readers these weird concepts are attested by top notch authorities of Salafi sect including Muhsin Khan the official translator of Qur'an by Saudi kingdom and their giant Muftis like Ibn Uthaymeen, Bin Baaz and Company)\n\n \n\n\nDid Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) see Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) on the night of ascension?\n\n \n\n\n\nThis article shall have abundant proofs from Qur'an but first we would like to reveal to the world a false translation of hadith in Sahih Muslim. Many people read translation of this hadith and start believing that it was actually what Prophet (Peace be upon him) said without verifying the original Arabic and how Muhaditheen read the word \"أَنَّى \"\n\n \n\n \n\nFalse Translation of hadith in Sahih Muslim\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBook 1, Number 0341: (Sahih Muslim - online version)\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr : I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Did you see thy Lord? He said: He is a Light, how could I see Him?\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNext Hadith:\n\n \n\n \n\nBook 1, Number 0342: (Sahih Muslim - online version)\n\n \n\nAbdullah b. Shaqiq reported: I said to Abu Dharr: Had I seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him. He (Abu Dharr) said: What is that thing that you wanted to inquire of him ? He said: I wanted to ask him whether he had seen his Lord. Abu Dharr said: I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: I saw Light.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFirst one (#0341) is a severely false translation. If we accept it on face value then the very next hadith (#0342) will contradict the previous one. Remember Imam Muslim (rah) was an expert in hadith sciences let alone he not knowing that he has narrated 2 totally contradicting hadiths adjacent to each other in his magnificent Sahih collection.\n\n \n\nFalse translation of first hadith (#0341) states: “:He is a Light, how could I see Him?\n\n \n\nHere the translation claims that Allah is a light so how could He be seen?!\n\n \n\nNow the next hadith (#0342) says: \"I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: “I SAW LIGHT”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLet us now move towards the Arabic of first hadith which actually proves without doubt that Prophet (Peace be upon him) actually said that \"He saw Allah\"\n\n \n\nحدّثنا أَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ : حَدَّثَنَا وَكِيعٌ عَنْ يَزِيدَ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَنْ قَتَادَةَ عَنْ عَبْدِ اللّهِ بْنِ شَقِيقٍ عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ ، قَالَ: سَأَلْتُ رَسُولَ اللّهِ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ رَبَّكَ؟ قَالَ: «نُورٌ انى أَرَاهُ»؟.\n\n \n\nTranslation of Matn: Narrated by Abu Dharr (RA): I asked the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him): Did you see your Lord? The Prophet (Peace be upon him) replied: He is Nur (نُورٌ) I Saw Him ( انى أَرَاهُ) [Sahih Muslim, Hadith # 351, Hadith number from Sharh Sahih Muslim by Allama Ghulam Rasool Sa’eedi – Damat Barkatahum Alia]\n\n \n\n\nThis is the perfect translation which actually proves that Prophet (Peace be upon him) did indeed see Allah.\n\n \n\nWe will show word by word translation over here:\n\n \n\nنُورٌ =    He is light\n\nانى =    I, me, myself\n\nأَرَاهُ =    saw Him\n\n \n\nHowever if we do not take this translation then Sahih Muslim will contradict itself as right in the next hadith it says:\n\n \n\nرَأَيْتُ نُوراً = I saw Light (i.e. for Sure I saw Allah)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIn Light of Qur'an\n\n\n \n\n\n\nوَهُوَ بِالْأُفُقِ الْأَعْلَىٰ  ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ  فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ  فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ مَا أَوْحَىٰ  مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَ‌أَىٰ  أَفَتُمَارُ‌ونَهُ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَ‌ىٰ\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTranslation: (7): While he was in the highest part of the horizon.(8): Then he approached and came closer (9): And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer. (10): So did (Allah) convey the inspiration to His Servant- (conveyed) what He (meant) to convey. (11): The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw. (12): Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw? [Al Qur'an, Chapter 53, Verse 7-12]\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the 12th verse our Lord Almighty is challenging the whole world that “WILL YE THEN DISPUTE WITH HIM CONCERNING WHAT HE SAW”, had it been seeing Gabriel only then that would not have been a great challenge because previous Prophets like Musa Kaleem-Ullah (Peace be upon him) had the privilege to talk “DIRECTLY WITH ALLAH” and Ibrahim (alaih salam) was shown the kingdoms of Heaven which was a far superior thing than seeing Gabriel, hence from Nass of Qur'an it now becomes established that vision of Allah was finally reserved for Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) as hadith of Ibn Abbas (RA) and many others prove it (Which shall come in the hadith section of this article)\n\n \n\n \n\nLet us see the detailed Tafsir of these verses by Imam Ibn-ul-Jawzi (rah),  he explains the 8th and 9th verses in light of Sahih ahadith and Aqwaal\n\n \n\n\nوفي المشار إليه بقوله: «ثُمَّ دنا» ثلاثة أقوال.\n\nأحدها: أنه الله عز وجل. روى البخاري ومسلم في «الصحيحين» من حديث شريك بن أبي نَمِر عن أنس بن مالك قال: دنا الجبّار ربُّ العِزَّة فتدلَّى حتى كان منه قابَ قوسين أو أدنى. وروى أبو سلمة عن ابن عباس: «ثم دنا» قال: دنا ربُّه فتدلَّى، وهذا اختيار مقاتل. قال: دنا الرَّبُّ من محمد ليلةَ أُسْرِي به،، فكان منه قابَ قوسين أو أدنى. وقد كشفتُ هذا الوجه في كتاب «المُغْني» وبيَّنتُ أنه ليس كما يخطُر بالبال من قُرب الأجسام وقطع المسافة، لأن ذلك يختص بالأجسام، والله منزَّه عن ذلك.\n\nوالثاني: أنه محمد دنا من ربِّه، قاله ابن عباس، والقرظي.\n\nوالثالث: أنه جبريل. ثم في الكلام قولان.\n\n\n \n\nTranslation: There are three famous sayings regarding the saying of Allah i.e. Then he approached and came closer\n\n\n \n\nFirst: That is Allah Azza wajjal as it is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim in “Sahihayn” the hadith from Sharik bin Abi Numayr who heard from Anas bin Malik (ra) who said: The Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till He was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer [Sahih Bukhari Hadith # 7518, Sahih Muslim Hadith # 162]\n\n \n\n...and It is narrated by Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas (ra) that {He approached} refers to Allah coming near, this is adopted by Maqatil (rah) who said: Allah came near to Muhammad (Peace be upon him) on the night of Isra And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer, however It is written in the book Al Mughni that this coming nearer does not refer to coming closer in sense of bodies nor distance as that is the case with bodily creations and Allah is High of such thing being attributed to him.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Second: That It was Muhammad (Peace be upon him) who went near Allah, this is said by Ibn Abbas (ra) and Qurzi(ra) too.\n\n\n \n\nThe Third: It was Gibril and there is Kalaam in this Qawl.. (Then Ibn Jawzi shows the opinion of Sahaba like Sayyidah Aisha - RA who were of the opinion that Prophet - Peace be upon him did not see Allah, why Sayyidah Aisha - RA believed such and how other Sahaba differed with her shall be explained in detail Insha'Allah)\n\n \n\nReference: Imam Ibn Jawzi in Zad al Maseer fi Ilm at Tafsir, Volume No. 8, Page No. 65-66\n\n \n\nHence From Qur'an and Sahih hadiths of Bukhari and Muslim which give best sharh of 8th and 9th verses It is proven that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah (Anas bin Malik R.A who is claimed to have rejected sight of Allah is proving in these ahadith that Prophet - Peace be upon him did see Allah, It is fundamental Usool of Hadith that If same sahabi says 2 contrary things then “Masbat (proof)” takes over “Nafi (i.e. rejection)”, so according to this Usool itself it is soundly established that the Prophet Peace be upon him did indeed see Allah and the Nafi of this has to be rejected)\n\n \n\nQur'an states at another place:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nوَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِيۤ أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَـٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ\n\n \n\nمَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي فَلَمَّا\n\n \n\nتَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكّاً وَخَرَّ موسَىٰ صَعِقاً فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِي\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: And when Musa (Moses) came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord (Allah) spoke to him; he said: \"O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.\" Allah said: \"You cannot see Me (Qur'an states: LAN TARANI NOT LAN URA), but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.\" So when his Lord appeared to the mountain , He made it collapse to dust, and Musa (Moses) fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.\"[Al Qur'an, Surah 7, Verse no 143]\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the world renowned Tafsir al Jalalyn (written by 2 great scholars Imam Jalal ud-din Suyuti and Imam al-Muhalli) it states:\n\n \n\n\n\nأَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَٰنِى } أي لا تقدر على رؤيتي، والتعبير به دون «لن أُرَى» يفيد إمكان رؤيته تعالى { وَلَٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ } الذي هو أقوى منك { فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ } ثبت { مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَٰنِى } أي تثبت لرؤيتي، وإلا فلا طاقة لك { فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ } أي ظهر من نوره قدر نصف أنملة الخنصر كما في حديث صححه الحاكم\n\n\nTranslation: {You shall not see Me},which means you do not have the capability to see me THE USE OF THE WORDING (LAN TARANI) RATHER THAN LAN URA (I.E. I SHALL NOT BE SEEN) IMPLIES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE ALLAH {But gaze at the mountain} which is stronger than you are, {And if it stands still in its place} then you shall see Me’, that is, [then] you shall remain fixed [able] to see Me, otherwise, you will not have the capacity [for it]. {And when his Lord revealed (His) glory to the mountain} i.e. When he manifested his light, equivalent to half a nail of little finger as this is mentioned in the sahih hadith of Hakim\n\n \n\nReference: Tafsir al Jalalyn, Page No. 167, Published by Dar Ibn Kathir, Damascus\n\n \n\nIn the Ayah Musa (a.s) said in the end: And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.\"(7:143)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTafsir ul Qurtubi\n\n\n\nImam al-Qurtubi (rah) explains it as:\n\n\nوأجمعت الأمة على أن هذه التوبة ما كانت عن معصية؛ فإن الأنبياء معصومون. وأيضاً عند أهل السنة والجماعة الرؤيةُ جائزةٌ.\n\n\nTranslation: The Imams are unanimous that (Musa a.s) asking for Tawba does not refer to sins because the Anbiya are infallible/Masoom, and in the opinion of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jammah the Sight of (Allah) is possible\n\n \n\nReference: Tafsir-ul-Qurtubi, Under 7:143\n\n \n\nHence it is decisively proven from Qur'an itself that Anbiya never ask for something Impossible, had sight of Allah not been possible then Musa (a.s) would not have asked for it and nor would have Allah linked it to the condition of mountain staying at its place. So the Vision was reserved only for Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) and not for Musa (alaih salam)\n\n \n\n\nIn Light of Hadith\n\n \n\n\nWe have Qawl of Ummul Momineen (Mother of All Believers) Hadrat Ayesha Saddiqa R.A and Verdict of leading authority over Tafsir of Qur'an amongst Sahaba i.e. Ibn Abbas R.A  who differed with Sayyidah Ayesha r.a in this regard. This difference has been wrongly understood by Salafis whereas in reality the rejection of Sayyidah Aisha (ra) is of \"IDRAAK (COMPLETE COMPREHENSION OF ALLAH)\" which we Ahlus Sunnah also reject, but rejection of Idraak does not mean Prophet did not see Allah at all.\n\n \n\nSecondly Sayyidah Aisha (ra) was a child when al-Isra Wal Mi'raaj took place, remember it took place in the Meccan period before Hijrah and Sayyidah Aisha (ra) was married to Prophet (Peace be upon him) 1 year \"AFTER HIJRAH\" and the Marriage took place when she was only 6 (consummated when she was 9). Hence Sayyidah Aisha (RA) was less than 4 years of age when incident of Mi'raaj took place, hence the opinion of senior Sahaba shall be taken into account as they understood the incident more properly. We would like to clarify that we accept the valid difference of opinion over this issue but the Istadlal of Wahabiyyah is null and void because they are people of Hawa (desires) and they do not follow a school of Jurisprudence nor do they follow the schools of Ahlus Sunnah called Ash'ari/Maturidi, hence even if they reach a valid opinion It will for sure stand rejected in sight Allah and his Apostle (Peace be upon him)\n\n \n\nBelow is the Sharh of the hadith from Aisha (RA) in words of the great Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (rah) whom the so called \"Muqalid Salafis claim to follow. This is cited by the leading commentator of Bukhari i.e. Imam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (rah)\n\n \n\n \n\nImam Ibn Hajr al Asqalani (Rahimuhullah) says in his magnificent Fath ul Bari Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari:\n\n\n\nعن المروزي قلت لأحمد إنهم يقولون إن عائشة قالت من زعم أن محمدا رأى ربه فقد أعظم على الله الفرية فبأي شيء يدفع قولها قال بقول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي قول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أكبر من قولها\n\nTranslation: Maruzi (rah) asked Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (rah): People say that Aisha (ra) used to exclaim that whosoever says the Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord has attributed a lie to Allah, so how shall this be answered? (Imam Ahmed) replied: From the saying of Prophet (Peace be upon him) [himself] when he said:  “رأيت ربي” i.e. I saw my Lord, this will be an answer to Aisha (ra)’s Qawl because the saying of Prophet (Peace be upon him) is far superior than saying of her (i.e. Aisha ra)\n\n \n\nReference: Best commentary over Sahih Bukhari called Fath ul Bari, Sharh Sahih ul Bukhari, Volume No. 8, Page No. 494\n\n\n\n \n\nImam an-Nawawi (rah) the leading commentator of Sahih Muslim sheds more light on this, as he explains:\n\n\n\n‏وإذا صحت الروايات عن ابن عباس في إثبات الرؤية وجب المصير إلى إثباتها فإنها ليست مما يدرك بالعقل , ويؤخذ بالظن , وإنما يتلقى بالسماع ولا يستجيز أحد أن يظن بابن عباس أنه تكلم في هذه المسألة بالظن والاجتهاد . وقد قال معمر بن راشد حين ذكر اختلاف عائشة وابن عباس : ما عائشة عندنا بأعلم من ابن عباس , ثم إن ابن عباس أثبت شيئا نفاه والمثبت مقدم على النافي\n\n\nTranslation: When it is proven from Sahih hadiths of Ibn Abbas (ra) then we cannot assume that he said it according to his own assumption, definitely he said this after hearing it from Prophet (Peace be upon him), Ma’mar bin Rashid (rah) said regarding the difference between Aisha (ra) and Ibn Abbas (ra) that Aisha (ra) was not aware about this (completely) whereas Ibn Abbas (ra) was, So when Ibn Abbas (ra) is proving it while some others are doing Nafi of it then It is a (Principle) that Masbat (Proof) takes over Nafi (rejection)\n\n \n\nReference: Sharh Sahih Muslim, Kitab al Iman, Chapter in meaning of :He saw him at the second descent\n\n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 1\n\n \n\nIbn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens (of Taqdir) Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: Return to thy Lord(‏فراجع ربك), for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord(فراجعت ربي) and He remitted a portion out of that. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord(‏راجع ربك),, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord(فراجعت ربي) and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said: I feel ashamed of my Lord(قد استحييت من ربي) [Sahih Muslim, Hadith No. 313 – Agreed upon]\n\nThis hadith decisively proves that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah because every time Musa (a.s) told him to “RETURN TO HIS LORD” and finally the Prophet said: “I FEEL ASHAMED OF MY LORD”\n\n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 2\n\n\n‏ عن ‏ ‏ابن عباس ‏ ‏قال ‏\nرأى ‏ ‏محمد ‏ ‏ربه قلت أليس الله يقول ‏\nلا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار ‏\n\nقال ويحك ذاك إذا تجلى بنوره الذي هو نوره وقال أريه مرتين ‏\nقال ‏ ‏أبو عيسى ‏ ‏هذا ‏ ‏حديث حسن\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Abbas (ra) said that Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord, (Ikrama) asked: Hasn’t Allah said that Eyes cannot “COMPREHEND” him, at this (Ibn Abbas) replied: Strange (Arabic wording is more strict but we have translated it to Strange) that you have not understood, this is when Allah shows glimpse of his own Nur (which cannot be comprehended), so Prophet (Peace be upon him) indeed saw Allah twice\n\n \n\nReference: Sunnan Tirimdh, Tafsir of Surah al-Najm, Hadith No. 3201] – Imam Tirimdhi declared this hadith as “Hassan”\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 3\n\n \n\nSheikh Muhadith Haq Dhelvi (rahimuhullah) writes: Ibn Umar(ra) turned to Ibn Abbas (ra) regarding this matter and asked whether the Prophet (Peace be upon him) has seen his Lord, Ibn Abbas replied in affirmative, Ibn Umar (ra) accepted this and did not reject it [Ashaat ul Lamaat, Volume No. 4, Page No. 431]\n\nNow It is proven from yet another Mujtahid Sahabi i.e. Ibn Umar (ra) that Prophet (Peace be upon him) saw Allah!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProof # 4\n\n\nImam Badr ud din Ayni (Rahimuhullah) the commentator of Bukhari said:\n\n\n\nروى ابن خزيمة بإسناد قوي عن أنس قال رأى محمد ربه وبه قال سائر أصحاب ابن عباس وكعب الأحبار والزهري وصاحب معمر وآخرون وحكى عبد الرزاق عن معمر عن الحسن أنه حلف أن محمدا رأى ربه وأخرج ابن خزيمة عن عروة بن الزبير إثباتها\n\n\nTranslation: Ibn Khuazaima (rah) narrated with “strong chain” from Anas bin Malik (ra) that he said: Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord, same is narrated from Ibn Abbas (ra) and his disciples like K’ab al Ahbar (ra), Zuhiri (rah) and Ma’mar (rah), Imam Abdur Razzaq (rah) narrates from Ma’mar who quotes Imam Hassan Basri (rah) who used to say: I take an oath that Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wassalam) saw his Lord, Ibn Khuzaima (rah) has also proven it (sight of Allah) from Urwa bin Zubayr (ra) [Umdat al Qari, Sharah Sahih al Bukhari, Volume No. 19, Page No. 198]\n\n \n\nTaking an oath by Imam Hasan al-Basri (rah) is not a minor thing.

Sayyidah Aisha(ra) rejected it and when Masruq (ra) asked her: O Umm ul Momineen (Mother of believers) did Muhammad (Peace be upon him) see his Lord? She replied: “My hair is standing on end at what you have asked” and she reported it three times “Whosoever told you that has lied. Whoever told you that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord has lied. Then she recited: “The eyes do not comprehend Him but He comprehends (all) vision. He is the Subtle, the Aware (6:103), some people agree with what Aisha (ra) said and it is well known that Ibn Masud (ra) and Abu Hurraira (ra) said similar things, stating that it was Jibril (a.s) he saw. However this is disputed.\n\n\nJamaah (great group) of the hadith scholars, fuqaha and theologians reject this statement and the prohibition on the Prophet of seeing Allah in this world. Ibn Abbas (ra) said: He saw Him with his eyes, while Ata related from him that he saw him with his heart. Abu’l Aliyya said that he saw him with his heart (and mind) twice. Ibn Ishaq mentioned that Ibn Umar (ra) sent to Ibn Abbas (ra) to ask him whether Muhammad (Peace be upon him) had seen his Lord? He replied: “Yes” The best known opinion is that he saw his Lord with his eyes. This is related from him by various paths of transmission. He said that Allah singled out Musa (a.s) for direct speech, Ibrahim (a.s) for close friendship and Muhammad (peace be upon him) for the (direct) vision.\n\n\nThe Proof of it lies in the words of Allah: “The heart (and mind) did not lie about what it saw, What will you dispute with him about what he sees? He saw him another time (53:12-13)\n\nAl-Mawaradi said: It is said that Allah divided his vision and His speech between Musa and Muhammad (Peace be upon them both). Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw Him twice and He spoke to Musa (a.s) twice.\n\nAbul Fath ar-Razi and Abul Layth as-Samarqandi relate this from Ka’b al-Ahbar (rah) and Abdullah ibn al Harith (rah) said that Ibn Abbas and Ka’b agreed on this point. Ibn Abbas (ra) said: As for us, the Banu Hashim, we say that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord twice., Ka’b said: Allah hu Akbar until the mountains echoed him. He further said: Allah divided his vision and speech between Muhammad and Musa (Peace be upon them both)\n\n\nSharik relates that when Abu Dharr (ra) commented on this ayat, he said: “The Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) saw his Lord. Imam Samarqandi [of the Islaaf] relates from Muhammad bin Ka’b al-Qurdhi and Rabi’ Ibn Anas that the Prophet was asked: Have you seen your Lord? He said: I saw Him with my heart, but I did not see him with my eye (Footnote by A: This chain is not authentic and does not reach the Prophet plus it has been established above that Prophet saw Allah with his eyesight, we the Ahlus Sunnah do not fabricate classical literature like Salafis do so our honesty asks us to relate things as they are without altering them). Malik ibn Yukhamir related from Mua’dh bin Jabal that the Prophet said: I saw my Lord and he asked me, Muhammad about what did the higher Assembly disagree [Absolutly sahih hadith on criteria of Bukhari]\n\n\nAbdur Razzaq ibn Hammam [The sheikh of Imam Bukhari, the best ever Muhadith as said by Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal] related that Hassan al Basri [He requires no introduction] used to take an oath (By Allah) that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw his Lord.\n\n[End Quote , Ash Shifa by Qadhi Iyaadh, Chapter on \"Sight of Allah\"]\n\n \n\n \n\nAlso see this following Fatwa from Ahlus Sunnah Dar-ul-Ifta\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRendered into English:\n\nQuestion: Did the Prophet (Peace be upon him) see his Lord?

[Book of Luke 24:36 (KJV), Rather the exact wording actually used by Jesus too was “shalom Aleichem” John 20:19, 21, 26]\n \n\nAuthor's Note: It is mostly Muslims who have kept this tradition alive and they say As-Salamu 'alaykum every time they meet, whereas others (including Christians) are paying the opportunity cost of changing this into Hello, Hi, Hiya, and a more formal way of greeting starting as \"Good morning (going up til Good night)\"  Saying Good morning to someone on a funeral for instance would be illogical or inappropriate, whereas the greeting with \"Salam\" is appropriate and soothing no matter what occasion or place we are at.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIn the world we live in today, our dear Muslim faith called \"al-Islam\" has unfortunately become the most misunderstood faith out of all religions. The primary reason for this is constant anti Islamic propaganda or rhetoric, and also some unaware/ignorant Muslims who do not understand Islam itself and hence give fuel to bigotry against their own faith without realizing it.  Some ignorant ones assume themselves to be the champions of Islam and with this pride they end up doing things which Islam never allowed them at first place (Hadith proves that, Pride and Faith cannot mix - Sahih Bukhari)\n\n \n\n \n\nWe are making this post on rights which Islam gives to non-Muslims because currently our world is going through a very delicate phase as was already told by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) when he said, that near the hour there would be a lot of killing. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) rather analyzed this present situation very deeply about 1430+ Years ago\n\n \n\nThe Hadith: The Killer would not know why he killed and the one who got killed would not know why he was killed [Two most authentic books of hadith i.e. Sahih Bukhari and Muslim  Hadith # 1356 in the latter]\n\n \n\nWe would like to write a commentary on this hadith and also go slightly off the topic so that when we come back, we have proper understanding of context of why this world has become such a bad place to live and why Islam is deliberately made to be misunderstood the most?\n\nThis hadith pretty much solves the problems faced by modern world today, the wars which are led by big countries upon smaller ones (Big fish eating small), but still putting the blame on the ones being mass murdered as always happened throughout history (Read Qur'an 2:11-12 to understand the ideology of state actors of terrorism), the preemptive full fledged genocides of people in Iraq and that too on false grounds of \"Weapons of Mass destruction\" (which were never found but rather had magical legs with which they ran into neighboring countries for future reference). Hence in this context the above hadith clearly proves that the killer (any state actor of terrorism) does not know why it killed and the ones being killed do not know why they were being bombarded\n\nRemember ignorance has become a norm in this world. It is spread on a wide scale and the biggest tool of ignorance is “Generalization” i.e. if some Muslim commits a crime then not only that person is to be blamed but rather all Muslims and Islam is to be attacked. We know for sure that Islam is not alone targeted but this blame has been put on other religions too, for example blame of crusades firmly lies upon Christianity,  wars as mentioned in Old testament somehow depict the God of Moses as a war monger according to secularists and atheists.\n\n \n\nThe Muslims on the other hand are declared as terrorists by default in order to carry out the long term and wide scale terrorism upon them. Unlike what west wants to propagate that Muslim scholarship never speaks against terrorism, we want to clarify once again that Muslims do not consider Muslims to be infallible. We accept that there are “Ignorant” Muslims too who legitimize the lame western propaganda by committing crimes which Islam totally shuns in it's primary sources.\n\n \n\nLet us now see what Islam says about rights of non-Muslims.\n\n \n\nQur'an states: O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you”INTO NATIONS AND TRIBES” that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the ”MOST RIGHTEOUS OF YOU” . And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). [49:13]\n\n \n\nThis verse is a constitutional law for all nations ordained in Qur'an.\n\n \n\nQur'an states at another place: Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in God hath grasped the most trustworthy hand- hold, that never breaks. And God heareth and knoweth all things. (2:256)\n\n \n\nThis above verse proves that If any Muslim forces a non-Muslim to accept Islam (let alone killing him due to difference in faith) then he is a blunt liar and transgressor because Qur'an forbids compelling others into faith at first place.\n\n \n\nThere is a whole chapter in Qur'an with the name of Al-Kafiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), some would assume straightaway that this chapter would have direct orders to kill all disbelievers at sight, but to their amazement let’s see what the chapter actually states:\n\n \n\n109.1: Say: O disbelievers!\n\n109.2: I worship not that which ye worship;\n\n109.3: Nor worship ye that which I worship.\n\n109.4: And I shall not worship that which ye worship.\n\n109.5: Nor will ye worship that which I worship.\n\n109.6: Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\n\n \n\n[Translation by a revert from Christianity to Islam i.e. Marmaduke Pickthal]\n\n \n\nThis short chapter of Qur'an which has been shown in totality, proves beyond doubt that Islam prescribes right in it's most holy scripture that everyone has freedom of religion and expression, without any if's and but's.\n\n \n\n \n\nSome would argue by taking Quranic verses out of context like many anti Islamic propagandists claim that Quran advises in 2:191 to kill disbelievers wherever one may find them (One of the most widely spread hoaxes in the world). They while grossly misquoting such verses know for sure that they are not being honest in the approach by hiding other part of the same verse itself and also ignoring 1 verse before and 2 verses afterwards which prove the context to be in regards to Battlefield only. Plus fighting was permitted against those disbelievers who had broken the treaties, initiated the fight, driven Muslims out of their own homeland, and committed worst barbarism upon Muslims.\n\n \n\nThe amount of importance and respect given to minorities in Islam is unimaginable when we read these following words of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), these words are so strong that If Muslims do not follow them then there is a chance of them having a total loss in their own faith.\n\n \n\nThe Prophet of Mercy said: Beware! Whosoever oppresses a Muahid (i.e. Non-Muslim living in Muslim land with agreement) or snatches (any of) his rights or causes him pain which he cannot bear, or takes anything from him without his permission, Then “I WILL FIGHT AGAINST SUCH A (MUSLIM) ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT” [Sunnan Abu Dawud, Volume No. 3, Page No. 170, Hadith No. 3052]\n\n \n\n \n\nI.E. the Prophet (Peace be upon him) will be a lawyer against such a Muslim, hence no sane Muslim should expect to win the case when the lawyer against him shall be none other than Muhammad (Peace be upon him) the law giver himself.\n\n \n\nThis is not just an advice but a  “LAW” in Islamic Jurisprudence.\n\n \n\nIn another hadith the Prophet (Peace be upon him) is more explicit, he said: If any Muslim killed a Muahid (i.e. non-Muslim living in Muslim land with agreement) then he (Muslim) shall not even smell the fragrance of Paradise although the fragrance of Paradise would have been perceived from the distance of travelling for 40 years [Sahih Bukhari, Volume No. 3, Hadith # 2995]\n\n \n\n\"Christians allowed to pray inside the Prophetic Mosque which is the most holy place after Mecca (a part from Prophetic grave which is more holier than even Ka'ba and Throne) \"\n\n \n\nHadith: Once a delegation of Christians comprising of 14 members came to Madina. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) made them stay in his mosque (i.e. Masjid an Nabwi) and he gave them permission to perform their worship in their own manner inside his Mosque. [Imam Ibn Sa’d in his Tabaqat al Kubra, Volume No. 1, Page No. 357]\n\n \n\n \n\nThe polytheists of Makkah had oppressed the Prophet (Peace be upon him) and his companions continuously to an extent that he and his companions remained expelled from their own homeland Makkah, however when Muslims won their freedom and went back to their homeland after a long and treacherous exile, a commander from Muslims exclaimed loudly:\n\n \n\nToday is a day of revenge (fight), at this the Prophet (Peace be upon him) became angry and said: Today is the day of open forgiveness, then he asked his enemies: How should I treat you today? They replied: We expect you to treat us Just like Prophet Joseph treated his wrongdoing brothers, the Prophet said in reply the same sentence which Joseph had said to his brothers: There is no questioning from you today and you are all free [Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani, Fath ul Bari, Volume No. 8, Page No. 18]\n\n \n\nThe biggest enemy of Muslims at that time was Abu Sufyan, the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: Whosoever takes shelter in “ABU SUFYAN’S HOUSE” is safe [Sahih Muslim, Volume No. 3, Hadith # 1780]\n\n \n\nThe west boasts about their so called wars for democracy, but they have never set such an example.\n\n \n\nAbu Lahab against whom a whole Surah has been revealed in Qur'an, his two sons who used to cause a lot of pain to Prophet (Peace be upon him), they after conquest of Makkah took shelter behind curtains of Kaaba, the Prophet himself brought them out and forgave them [Imam Zayli, Nasb ar Raiya 3:336]\n\n \n\nWhereas the legitimate leader of Libya i.e. Qaddafi was unjustly killed through the hands of American created rebels (although previously USA had failed to kill him by shooting missiles at his whereabouts, finally they realized that the most convenient and clever way to destabilize a whole Muslim country is by creating a civil war within)\n\n \n\nThe Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: To protect the rights (of non-Muslims) is amongst the primary duties of mine [Sunnan Baihaqi, Volume No. 8, Page No. 30]\n\n \n\nOnce a governor of Egypt punished a non-Muslim wrongly, the case was brought to the caliph of time i.e. Umar ibn ul Khattab (the second caliph of Islam), the Muslim governor was proven to be wrong,  Umar the great (ra) told the non Muslim to punish the Egyptian governor in same fashion, after it Umar (ra) said: Since when have you considered people as your slaves? Although their mothers gave birth to them as free living people [Kanz ul Amaal, Volume No. 4, Page No. 455]\n\n \n\nQuran states the ethics with which people could be invited towards Islam: Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance. (16:125)\n\n \n\nThe decision of guidance or misguidance of someone is to be attributed to Allah as authority over it is only in His hands, even Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was told by Allah (sometimes strictly) that his duty was only to convey the message.\n\n \n\nQuran states: If it had been thy Lord's will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe?(10:99)\n\n \n\nThe Prophet (Salallaho alaihi wasalam) said: Najran (i.e. Christian land) and its leaders are assured the security from Allah and his Apostle. Their lives, their legislation, land, wealth, near and far away people, their worship places will be protected. No priest from his religious post, no officer of his official post shall be removed [Tabaqat Ibn Saad, Volume No. 1 Page No. 228]\n\n \n\nAs Muslims have to give “OBLIGATORY CHARITY” similarly the non-Muslims living in Muslim lands had to give Jiziya Tax, however Islam does not put this condition upon “POOR, OLD AND INCAPABLE” non Muslims.\n\n \n\nIt states in one of the leading book of Islamic Jurisprudence: If they are poor, old or suffering (from financial or physical ailments) to the extent that people from their own faith start giving them charity then the Law of Jiziya will be “LIFTED” from them and from Bayt ul Maal (Muslim house of wealth i.e. a bank) they will be helped instead but till the time they live in the Muslim land [Imam Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-Khiraaj, Page No. 155]\n\n \n\nQuran states: Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just. (60:8)\n\n \n\nQuran states: Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good (to others) and the giving to the kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion; He admonishes you that you may be mindful(16:90)\n\n \n\nPeace!\n\n \n\nShare\n \nPowered by Joomla!. valid XHTML and CSS."},

          {text: "This article provides a comprehensive and insightful overview of the rights of non-Muslims in Islam, emphasizing the principles of tolerance, justice, and respect enshrined within the faith. It effectively counters common misconceptions and misrepresentations of Islam, particularly regarding its treatment of minorities.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the article:\n\n**1. Emphasis on Peace and Respect:**\n\n* The article begins with the Islamic greeting \"Salamun Alaykum\" (Peace be unto you), highlighting its universality and emphasizing the importance of peace in Islam.\n* It contrasts this with the more formal greetings used in other cultures, suggesting that \"Salam\" is a more appropriate and soothing greeting regardless of the occasion.\n\n**2. Condemnation of Compulsion in Religion:**\n\n* The article cites Quranic verses (2:256 and 49:13) that explicitly forbid compulsion in religion and emphasize the importance of individual freedom of belief.\n* It also highlights the chapter \"Al-Kafiroon\" (The Disbelievers), which emphasizes the right to one's own religion and the principle of \"unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\"\n\n**3. Protection of Non-Muslims in Muslim Lands:**\n\n* The article emphasizes the Prophet's (PBUH) strong pronouncements on the protection of non-Muslims living in Muslim lands (Muahids), stating that those who oppress them will face severe consequences on the Day of Judgment.\n* It cites Hadiths that highlight the Prophet's (PBUH) commitment to justice and forgiveness, even towards his enemies, and the example of Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) who ensured justice for a non-Muslim who was wronged by a Muslim governor.\n\n**4. Ethical Guidance for Interfaith Relations:**\n\n* The article emphasizes the Quranic injunction to invite people to Islam with wisdom and beautiful preaching (16:125), highlighting the importance of respectful dialogue and avoiding coercion.\n* It also cites the verse (10:99) that emphasizes that Allah alone guides people and that humans cannot force them to believe.\n\n**5. Historical Examples of Tolerance:**\n\n* The article provides historical examples of the Prophet's (PBUH) and the early Caliphs' treatment of non-Muslims, including allowing Christians to pray in the Prophet's Mosque and granting amnesty to his enemies after the conquest of Makkah.\n* It contrasts this with the actions of Western powers, highlighting the hypocrisy of their claims to promote democracy while engaging in wars and oppression.\n\n**6. Jizya Tax and its Limitations:**\n\n* The article acknowledges the existence of the Jizya tax, but emphasizes that it was not imposed on the poor, old, or disabled.\n* It highlights the Islamic principle of providing financial assistance to those in need, regardless of their faith.\n\n**7. Universal Principles of Justice and Kindness:**\n\n* The article concludes by citing Quranic verses (60:8 and 16:90) that emphasize the importance of justice, kindness, and good deeds towards all people, regardless of their faith.\n\n**Overall, the article effectively presents a strong case for the Islamic principles of tolerance, justice, and respect for non-Muslims. It is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to understand the true nature of Islam and its teachings on interfaith relations.**\n\n**However, it's important to remember that:**\n\n* **This is just one perspective within Ahlus Sunnah:** There are other interpretations and schools of thought within Ahlus Sunnah.\n* **It's crucial to consult with qualified scholars:**  This article provides valuable insights, but it's essential to seek guidance from knowledgeable Imams and scholars for a deeper understanding of these complex issues.\n\nIf you have any further questions or want to explore specific points in more detail, feel free to ask. \n"},

[ 9 ]\nOn April 28, 2011, Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a backed by Transitional Federal Government soldiers were fighting against Al-Shabaab in the town of Luuq in the Gedo region. 27 Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a- and 8 TFG soldier were killed during the battle. Al-Shabaab casualties were unknown.[citation needed]\nOn May 3, 2011, several hours of fighting between Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a backed by TFG soldiers against Al-Shabaab took place in the town of Garbaharey in the Gedo region. The town fell into the hands of Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a and TFG. 3 Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a- and 23 Al-Shabaab fighters were killed in action.[citation needed] During the fighting Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a's chairman of Gedo region Sheikh Hassan Sheikh Ahmed (aka Qoryoley) was wounded. He died in a Nairobi hospital 2 days later.[10][11]\nOn March 1, 2012, heavy clashes between Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a backed by TFG soldiers and Al-Shabaab fighters took place in Garbaharey town, the capital of Gedo region in Southern Somalia. Government officials said that Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'a and TFG fighters successfully repelled Al-Shabaab attacks on government bases throughout the night of February 29 and March 1.\nOn January 18, 2014, Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a's leadership objected to the new Cabinet lineup named by federal Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed. ASWJ Chairperson Sheik Ibrahim Hassan Gureye argued that many of the new ministerial positions went to unsuccessful officials from previous administrations, so the outcome of their reappointments would likely be the same.[12]\nOn February 11, 2015, a dispute erupted in the town of Guricel, 400 km north of Mogadishu. The town is in Galgaduud, west of Dhuasamareb. The dispute took place between Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a and Somali National Army fighters, and led to at least 16 dead (three of whom were civilians) and 14 wounded. The dispute was apparently related to a local power struggle between politicians meeting in Dhuasamareb, in the north-central Galgadud region. The soldiers then withdrew from the town.[13] A counterattack involving shelling from both sides was organized the following day with the soldiers withdrawing after 9 combatants were killed.[14] Ahlu Sunna spokesman Abdinoor Mohamed Hussein later clarified that the dispute was not between Somali government troops and Ahlu Sunna, but instead between Ahlu Sunna and two particular state officials, Mahad Mohamed Salad, the State Minister for the Presidency, and Mohamed Roble Jimale 'Gobale', Commander of Brigade 3 in Mogadishu. Ahlu Sunna accused the two men of misusing and hiding behind federal manpower and resources to settle personal grievances with the group.[15]\nOn February 14, a delegation of politicians and traditional elders led by former president of Galmudug regional state Mohamed Ahmed Ma'alim brokered a ceasefire between the feuding parties. The unconditional truce was slated to be followed by reconciliation talks amongst the local stakeholders.[16]\nOn 5 March, Minister of Defense Abdulkadir Sheikh Dini and Ahlu Sunna leader Sheikh Mohamed Shakir signed a five-point joint agreement stipulating that there would be a bilateral ceasefire, troops would retreat without any offensives or arms use, government forces would be garrisoned in Dhusamareeb while Ahlu Sunna troops would be stationed in Guriel, displaced local residents should return to their houses, and a reconciliation conference would be launched within a ten-day window period.[17]\nOn 18 January 2018, Ahlu Sunna merged its forces and administration into Galmudug State's regional government and security forces.[18]\nRenewed fighting began in September 2021 in the Galgadud region is due to a dispute between Ahlu Sunna and the Galmudug regional administration.\n\nOn 30 September 2021, fighting broke out in Bohol near Dhusamareb. At least 10 people were killed and many were wounded.\nOn 1 October 2021, Ahlu Sunna seized the town of Guri El.[19]\nSee also\nIslam in Somalia\nSomali Civil War (2009–present)\nAhle Sunnat Barelvi, a Sufi movement with a similar ideology in South Asia\nArmy of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order, a militant Sufi movement with a similar ideology in Iraq\nReferences\n \"Somalia: Ahlu Sunna – We resolved our antenatal disagreements\".

Literal Interpretation:**\n\n* This interpretation takes the hadith literally, meaning that Allah physically descends to the lowest heaven in the last part of the night. \n* This view is often associated with certain branches of Salafism, who emphasize the literal interpretation of Quran and Hadith.\n* They argue that Allah's descent is a physical act, similar to how a human being might descend from one place to another.\n\n**2. Figurative Interpretation:**\n\n* This interpretation views the hadith as a metaphor, signifying Allah's mercy and closeness to believers, particularly during the last part of the night.\n* This view is prevalent among the majority of Ahlus Sunnah scholars, who emphasize the importance of understanding the Quran and Hadith in light of their context and the attributes of Allah.\n* They argue that Allah's descent is not a physical act but a metaphorical representation of His attention and responsiveness to those who seek Him.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n* **Nature of Descent:** Literal interpretation sees it as a physical act, while figurative interpretation sees it as a metaphorical representation of Allah's closeness.\n* **Understanding of Allah's Attributes:** Literal interpretation can lead to anthropomorphism (attributing human-like qualities to Allah), while figurative interpretation emphasizes Allah's transcendence and uniqueness.\n* **Implications for Worship:** Literal interpretation might lead to specific practices related to the time of Allah's descent, while figurative interpretation emphasizes the importance of seeking Allah's mercy and closeness at all times.\n\n**It's important to note that:**\n\n* Both interpretations are held by respected scholars within Islam.\n* The choice of interpretation is a matter of scholarly debate and should be approached with humility and respect for different perspectives.\n* It's crucial to consult with qualified scholars for a deeper understanding of these complex issues.\n\nUltimately, the understanding of this hadith, like many others, is a matter of individual interpretation and should be based on careful study and reflection. \n"},
